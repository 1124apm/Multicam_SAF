DATE: 2020

The knighthood – which means he will be known formally as Sir Lewis Hamilton – has been awarded at the end of a year that saw him match Michael Schumacher’s record of seven F1 World Championship titles and surpass the German's race wins tally.

He has also pursued a campaign to increase diversity in the sport and frequently spoken out against racism in society, although the honour is for his services to motorsports. It comes exactly 12 years after Hamilton, following his first World Championship title, became a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for services to motor racing.

Hamilton is the third F1 World Champion to receive a knighthood, following Jack Brabham (in 1978) and Jackie Stewart (2001), while the honour also went to Stirling Moss (2000). However, Hamilton is the first to gain this status while still an active driver.

In addition, racers and land speed record breakers Henry Segrave (1929) and Malcolm Campbell (1931) were both knighted before World War II.

Aside from drivers, Williams F1 team founders Frank Williams and Patrick Head have also received knighthoods, in 1999 and 2015 respectively.

Hamilton has been awarded a knighthood at the age of just 35, although he is not the youngest sportsman to be recognised in the modern era. Tennis star Andy Murray was 29 when he was named in the 2017 New Year Honours list, following his second Wimbledon victory, while cyclists Bradley Wiggins and Chris Hoy were both 32. Sailor Ellen MacArthur was 28 when she was made a dame, the equivalent of a knighthood, in 2005.

New F1 CEO , who officially starts work in January, has paid tribute to Hamilton.

“Lewis is a true giant of our sport and his influence is huge both in and out of a car,” said Domenicali. “What he has achieved is phenomenal with still more to come.

“All of us at F1 congratulate him on this well-deserved recognition of his achievements and look forward to seeing more of his brilliance in 2021.”

Mercedes-Benz AMG F1 team principal Toto Wolff commented: "Lewis is one of the very greatest racing drivers of all time and the most successful British sportsperson of his era. Around the world, he has long been recognised for his sporting achievement; this year, he combined his excellence on the track with a powerful voice to fight discrimination. In every sense, he led the way in 2020.

Earlier this month Hamilton received recognition from the British public when he was voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year for a second time, having previously won the prestigious award in 2014.

He also won the 2020 Laureus World Sports Award for Sportsman of the Year prize, sharing it with footballer Lionel Messi.

Max Verstappen dominated the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to give Red Bull its second victory of the season, leading home the Mercedes duo of Valtteri Bottas and Hamilton, who finished third.

Verstappen led every single lap of the race at the Yas Marina Circuit, as neither Bottas nor Hamilton managed to get close to the Dutchman as they struggled with their tyres.

Although the result had no impact on the final championship standings - Mercedes and Hamilton both wrapped up their respective titles last month - Hamilton felt the race proved Mercedes would face a sterner challenge from Red Bull next year.

"We've obviously got a fight on our hands next year," Hamilton said following the race in Abu Dhabi.

"Without a doubt, these guys are going to be strong, as this car [Verstappen] is driving now is next year's car pretty much, and the same for us.

"I'm excited for that challenge, and that battle that we hopefully will get."

Bottas was able to clinch second place in the drivers' championship despite Verstappen's victory, ultimately finishing nine points clear in the final standings.

Bottas echoed Hamilton's thoughts, saying the defeat to Red Bull at the final round of the year would only serve as added motivation for Mercedes heading into the winter.

"If we think about the big pictures, now in this team, being beaten by Red Bull at the last race of the season, for sure it motivates us even more to work hard over the winter for next year to make sure this doesn't happen again," Bottas said.

Mercedes F1 chief Toto Wolff called the defeat a "slap on the wrist" for Mercedes, while trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin said the team now had to work to understand why it was so uncompetitive at the front.

"Fundamentally today, we didn't have the best car," said Shovlin after the race.

"We need to look at whether we could have got more out of it, whether it was an issue with where we positioned it in terms of set-up or whether it's something to do with this circuit that's suiting the Red Bull.

"There's a lot there that simply we don't understand right, and that's just going to sit on the job list of things for us to get stuck into over the next week or so.

"We didn't have a difference in car pace, so in a way, it was lost yesterday, which was a close battle, but looking at it today, unless we had a car on pole, I think we would have struggled."

The Woking-based outfit pipped rival Racing Point for the best-of-the-rest slot behind the top two teams in the F1 season finale in Abu Dhabi last weekend.

The result, coming off the back of , comes amid suggestions that McLaren could make a big step forward as it switches to Mercedes engines next season.

But Seidl is cautious about expecting too much from McLaren next year, as he says the team must accept the two outfits ahead of it are still a step clear.

“I think we need to stay realistic,” he said. “Despite the good result we have this weekend and, despite the great outcome for us in the championship side, with P3, I think we know exactly where we are. There's still a huge gap to the cars in front, especially the Mercedes car.”

Seidl does take huge encouragement from the progress that McLaren was able to make with its MCL35 this year, as well as the way in which it executed race weekends and dealt with an aggressive update strategy.

However, with McLaren openly admitting that it needs to improve its wind tunnel, simulation facilities and simulator, Seidl thinks it will take a few years before it can hope to get on terms with teams like Mercedes.

“I think the most important thing is to first of all see that the team this year, under the leadership of James Key, has produced a very competitive car,” he explained. “It is a step forward compared to last year.

“It was great to see also that despite all these challenges in the pandemic, that the team kept pushing flat out back home in engineering, and in production, to continuously bring updates to the track, which in the end, kept improving the performance of the car.

“And of course it's a great finish to the season, knowing that at this track, at this specific event, we had the third fastest car.

“But still, we know what the gap to Mercedes is. It is not something we will close from one year to the next year.

“We still know that we have a lot of deficits within the team in terms of organisation, in terms of infrastructure, which we need to close first.

“But again, we have a clear plan of how we want to reduce these deficits. It will take time. But I'm confident that if we do the right things on the team side, we can close these gaps in some years.”

DATE: 2020

Hamilton clinched his seventh F1 world title in 2020 with three races to spare, but is out of contract at the end of the year after deciding to postpone talks with Mercedes until the championship was settled.

But after Hamilton tested positive for COVID-19 following the Bahrain Grand Prix at the end of last month, Mercedes was forced to shelve talks after making “baby steps”.

Both Hamilton and Mercedes have always expressed their desire to continue their relationship that has yielded 74 race wins and six world titles, insisting that a new deal was a formality.

Asked following Sunday’s 2020 season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix for a timeframe on when a deal could be struck, Hamilton said he hoped a new contract could be sewn up in the short period before Christmas.

“Hopefully over the next couple of weeks,” Hamilton said.

“We would love to get it done before Christmas, I think. I plan to be here next year. I want to be here next year. I think us, as a team, have more to do together and more to achieve both in the sport but even more outside the sport.

“I hope we can begin this week, discussions, and hopefully get it tied up before Christmas.”

Mercedes is one of just three teams yet to finalise its line-up for the 2020 season, having only announced Valtteri Bottas to date. Both Red Bull and AlphaTauri are yet to formalise who will drive for them next year.

Unlike those two teams, Mercedes did list Hamilton in its line-up for next year on the initial FIA entry list that emerged last week.

Mercedes chief Toto Wolff said a new deal with Hamilton was “going to happen” and that there’s “no reason it shouldn’t happen”, and had simply been delayed by his recovery from COVID-19.

"We will have this conversation,” Wolff said.

“We were delayed. We always said we would do it after the title was won, and then the virus delayed us for another 10 days, two weeks.

“Now we just have to sit down, maybe virtually, maybe live.”

Team principal Toto Wolff revealed on Saturday that a "gremlin" related to the MGU-K meant .

Max Verstappen took pole position for Red Bull on Saturday ahead of Mercedes drivers Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton, and was able to comfortably defeat them in the race.

Verstappen mentioned that Mercedes had its power units turned down in the press conference, but neither Bottas nor Hamilton were aware.

Bottas finished more than 15 seconds behind Verstappen at the chequered flag, while Hamilton crossed the line less than two seconds clear of Alexander Albon, who finished fourth in the sister Red Bull car.

Mercedes trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin explained after the race that the power unit setting did not explain such a big gap to the Red Bull's pace, calling its impact "small".

"[It was] not an amount that's going to determine the race result," Shovlin said.

"You're talking significantly less than a tenth of a second, so not the difference between first and second."

Shovlin said the MGU-K issue was "not fully understood yet", and that the decision to run the power units in the conservative mode came through caution.

"I would say that rather than being acutely aware of a specific problem, we are operating the power unit in a way that is as conservative as we can be in order to try and avoid a problem," Shovlin said.

"But when you don't understand exactly the string of issues, all you can do is just be a bit cautious.

"During the race we were trying to reduce the duty marginally, but you're right, the drivers wouldn't have necessarily been aware of it.

"It was just something we were trying to manage in the background."

Mercedes was denied the chance to try and split strategies to pincer Verstappen with its cars by a safety car period early on that forced most teams on to the same strategy.

But Shovlin doubted split strategies would have been enough to beat Red Bull in Abu Dhabi.

"You can do something different, but to be honest, the result would probably be relatively inevitable," Shovlin said.

"Once you have all cars on the same age tyres, it neutralises the racing a bit and there wasn't a lot of opportunity therein.

"If it hadn't been for [the safety car], we would have probably used one car to pull Max in, let the other one go long, try to create a tyre delta.

"Whether it would have resulted in any position gain, looking at their pace, they were very comfortable, so I doubt it."

Mercedes swept to a seventh consecutive set of drivers' and constructors' championships in 2020, ending the season with 13 victories from 17 races.

The team was chasing its seventh win in a row at the Yas Marina Circuit, but struggled to match Verstappen's pace in the Red Bull as he dominated the race from pole position.

Verstappen ultimately won the race by over 15 seconds as Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton finished second and third respectively for Mercedes.

Mercedes team boss Wolff felt that both Red Bull cars were "simply quicker than us" through the Abu Dhabi weekend, and feared that Alexander Albon would pass Hamilton for third in the closing stages.

"You can see that everybody has weaknesses, and we weren't on our A game this weekend," Wolff said.

"That's simply a fact. Red Bull won fair and square. You can see that Albon also had a very good race, so they have a very good race car, and shows that when their car is in the right place, both drivers do a really good job.

"Probably Albon's pace was quicker than us by the end. They could have been well ahead, and even worse for us."

"We're leaving this race with a slap on the wrist. It wasn't a great weekend for us. It was a car that has never let us down all year, maybe apart from this last weekend."

Wolff explained that both Bottas and Hamilton were forced to manage their tyres after the safety car forced an early switch to the hard compound tyre that Mercedes was uncertain would make it to the end.

"Him and Lewis were looking after the tyres a lot, because it was not clear the hard would last until the end, and there was more pace in both of them,"Wolff said.

"You can see at the end, we saw through sector one, that our car wasn't simply turning around five and six, and the last sector wasn't great.

"We just simply had an understeery car all day today. We had a car that is good on Friday, but not good on Saturday. We tried both directions, weakened the rear, none of that helped.

"I think somehow we didn't get it right."

With power unit components getting towards the end of their life, Mercedes' worries have been heightened by a recent run of breakages.

Racing Point’s Sergio Perez lost a near-certain podium at the Bahrain Grand Prix when he suffered an MGU-K failure late in the race, while George Russell suffered a similar issue in Friday practice in Abu Dhabi.

Amid no definitive answer as to what is going wrong with the MGU-Ks, Mercedes has elected to try to play things safe for the season finale.

Turning the power down a bit almost certainly played a part in helping Max Verstappen take the first non-Mercedes powered pole position this season.

Asked about the situation, Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff confirmed that all the power units had been backed off a bit.

“We've got a bit of a gremlin sitting in there,” he said.

“The MGU-K is below the power that it should normally give. We don't understand exactly why yet. So we've taken a bit of performance out of it, on all the Mercedes engines.”

The question marks over Mercedes' reliability played a part in  for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. It means the Mexican will start from the back of the grid.

Although the engine factor hindered Mercedes’ performance in qualifying, Wolff says that Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas’ efforts have also been hampered by difficulties getting on top of the tyres this weekend.

“We didn't get the soft tyre right,” explained Wolff. “That's an outlier. The overall gap to the field is much smaller than we would have liked and we have to learn from that now.

“We can't say exactly what it is yet. We did quite well on the medium. The tyre suited us much better than the soft. But we were also very strong on the soft this year. You have to analyse the data, but we are not there yet.”

Albon put in what he felt was his best qualifying performance of the season to earn fifth on the grid for what could be a decisive race as he tries to hang onto his seat for next year.

Red Bull’s management has given him until the final event of the season to prove himself in the face of strong competition from Sergio Perez.

The top three qualifiers, Verstappen, Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton, all qualified on medium tyres.

However, Albon made a mistake on his medium run in Q2 and will thus start on softs, as does surprise fourth-placed man Lando Norris.

For most of the season Verstappen has been left to fight Hamilton and Bottas alone, giving Mercedes more strategy options.

“Yeah, that's the goal,” said Albon when asked the plan was to help the Dutchman take on the Mercedes drivers.

“Obviously, it's a bit of a shame because I ran a bit wide on my medium tyre run. And we didn't want to take the risk to run the mediums again, for Q2 run two, so we put the softs on, which isn't ideal, because the deg is quite high here. So that first stint might be a little bit difficult.

“But the plan is to stay close, and to be there in the mix. We've got Lando in between us. He did a very good lap, actually, so we'll have to be mindful of that.

“And of course, the McLarens are around me, and they're the best starters on the grid. So we'll focus on a good launch and trying to be in there and trying to disturb the Mercedes strategy.”

Albon felt that he has made progress in understanding the RB16.

“We know what's clicked,” he said. “I think it's important that of course, understanding why.

"And I think you can already see it, if you watch Max's onboard, if you watch the laps that he does, the car is never still, it's always on the edge, it's always moving around.

“And especially the car is on the edge and the rear is quite sensitive, to be able to have that feeling, that confidence to run that much front in the car, let's say, and then to be comfortable with it.

“That's what's really important and that bit was quite difficult, especially at the start of the year, but it feels like as I said, we did some things behind the scenes and I just feel more more comfortable to be on that kind of neutral side of the car balance, and being able to wrestle the car a bit more.”

Regarding his future, Albon insists he doesn’t know what the timing would be on a decision from Red Bull.

“On my side it's just more about doing the best job I can right now, and having a good day today is obviously positive,” he said.

“Of course I would have wanted to be a bit better, but I've still got tomorrow to do a good job.

"At least on see my side it's more about doing the best job I can, and making sure I've done everything that is in my control to get the seat for next year.

“I mean, truthfully, [the timing] doesn't change too much. Because firstly, I've been in this position many a time, not knowing what I'm gonna do at this time of the year. But also it doesn't change how I go into the race.

“Of course, it would be nice to know. But it is the holidays after this. So obviously with family, and there's no more races coming up after this one. So I won't be constantly thinking about it, I'll be eating turkey.”

Hamilton spent 10 days in isolation in Bahrain after testing positive for COVID-19 soon after the first of the two races there, and he was forced to miss last weekend’s Sakhir GP.

After testing negative he was allowed to travel from Bahrain to Abu Dhabi on Thursday, and was cleared to enter the paddock on Friday. He set the pace for much of qualifying on Saturday, topping both Q1 and Q2. However, he had to settle for third in Q3’s top-10 shootout, behind Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas.

After qualifying, Hamilton admitted he didn’t feel fully fit but said he was determined to do his best in Sunday’s race.

“I can really feel for those who are and have suffered from it, those who have lost ones from it and I can understand how because it’s a nasty virus,” he said. “I’m not one hundred percent. I still have some feeling within my lungs but nonetheless, normally I would drive if one of my arms was hanging off. That’s what we do as racing drivers and luckily that’s not the case.

“It definitely won’t be the easiest of races physically. I mean, I will manage and give it absolutely everything I’ve got.”

Asked if Hamilton was fit enough to race, Wolff insisted that he would always want to be back in his car as soon as possible.

“Well, our race drivers always are obviously keen on returning to the racecar, even if he isn't one hundred percent,” said the Austrian. “I think that's expected after 10 days of COVID-19. You're not going to be on your A-game, but I think absolutely good enough to race.

“I think it’s absolutely his call to decide whether he’s fit enough or not. He’s a very experienced driver, he knows very well about his health, and he has been tested negative, and sometimes drivers are not perfectly well but they still race, and I think this is the situation.”

Hamilton has not yet been officially confirmed as staying with Mercedes for 2021, but he was listed on an FIA entry list that was issued this weekend. Asked by Motorsport.com if it meant that an announcement is coming soon Wolff admitted that Hamilton’s health situation had delayed the process.

“Yeah, I was thinking who to put there, either Lewis or myself!” Wolff quipped of the entry list. “But at the end, I opted for Lewis. Yeah, hopefully soon.

“I think we were delayed by him being unwell, and I think that’s not the right time to sit down. We were planning to sit down the other week, so it’s going to be a little bit later. But I don’t want to put a date to it, because I don’t want to be hounded about why it's not signed yet.”

DATE: 2020

The world champion had missed last weekend's race in Bahrain after contracting coronavirus, but was given the all-clear ahead of the F1 season finale in Abu Dhabi.

After getting back up to speed on Friday, Hamilton took third place on the grid, behind pole position man Max Verstappen and Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas.

And although he missed just one race, he says it has been hard to get fully back into the swing of things.

"It's definitely been a difficult weekend I would say, just getting back into rhythm," he said. "Even though it's only a couple weeks off, it just felt like you lost that momentum.

"And I've really struggled so far already with the balance this weekend. But still I gave it my all.

"And, you know, congratulations to Max, it's great way for him to seal the year, a year of great performance. But we're going to hopefully give them a good run for their money tomorrow."

Hamilton ended up just 0.086 seconds behind teammate Bottas in which was a super tight battle for the top grid positions.

Bottas felt that Mercedes had never really got on top of the soft tyres all weekend, and that the track went away from them as the session went on.

"We saw in practice three that Red Bull and especially Max was pretty quick," said the Finn. "I think the main issue was we couldn't really get the soft tyres to work properly as they should, so all the way until qualifying the medium tyre was feeling better for us than the soft.

"Towards the end of qualifying I started to struggle a bit more with the front end of the car, maybe with the track temp cooling down.

"So then it made it difficult to improve more, because I thought it should have been quite a bit quicker than the earlier sessions. But, obviously, I think Red Bull managed to optimise everything for the last part of the qualifying which matters."

after a difficult run of form that has seen him struggle to match the sister Mercedes car.

Hamilton clinched his seventh world title at the Turkish Grand Prix, and has won 11 races to Bottas’s two this year to sit over 100 points clear at the top of the drivers’ standings.

Hamilton missed the Sakhir Grand Prix after testing positive for COVID-19, but his replacement, George Russell, was able to outpace Bottas for much of the race, and would likely have won had it not been for a pit stop error and a late puncture.

Mercedes F1 chief Wolff has often spoken about the mental toughness that Bottas shows, citing it as one of his greatest strengths.

But Wolff acknowledged that losing the title to Hamilton once again would have an impact on Bottas, and reiterated Mercedes’ full support for the Finn to help him bounce back.

“He’s a hard, resilient guy,” Wolff said.

“Losing a title is not something that is easy to digest and it’s not expected to be easy to digest.

“But he has the unconditional support within the team, and I think from year to year it makes him more eager to win.

“Winning against the best guy could probably be the biggest satisfaction that a racing driver could have. But that it takes its toll, is to be expected.”

Wolff said the whole Mercedes F1 family was there to support Bottas and put an arm around him to help reassure him of his performances.

“All of us, I think it’s not only me, he has this unconditional support from everybody in the team,” Wolff said.

“I think he’s able to pick himself up, and he has a family that does, and then he has his teammates, all of us.”

Bottas revealed on Thursday that he avoided all social media and news in the wake of his difficult weekend in Sakhir, where he finished eighth after dropping down the order in the final stint.

He was able to set the pace on Friday in Abu Dhabi, .

“It’s nice to see him healthy and back,” Bottas said of Hamilton’s return. “For sure you don’t wish anyone to have that virus.

“Apparently it was not that mild, so it’s good to see him happy being back in the car.

“I’m just really focusing this weekend on my own work, mentally trying to be in a good place and take it lap by lap. But so far, so good.”

afternoon, after a number of successful negative tests for coronavirus.

But he wasted little time in getting up to speed on his comeback, and  just behind his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas.

Speaking for the first time since he came back to the paddock, Hamilton told Sky: “I was very, very happy and grateful this morning, just to be back here. And, obviously to be able to try and finish off the season strong, I was super excited.

“It felt like a first day back to school kind of thing. So it definitely took a minute to get back used to it for the first session, and then the second one, I think [I was] still getting my bearings, but not too bad.

“I think we got through most of the stuff we missed out in the 40 minute session [stop when his brakes were being fixed] at the start of the day, but otherwise got most of the stuff done.”

Hamilton said he felt no pressure to need to come back for the final race of the season, having already won the championship, but said he was eager to enjoy one last outing this year.

“I just want to come here and enjoy it this weekend and enjoy what I do,” he said. “It's been a huge amount of work from everyone back at the factories, and it's been a privilege to race with them this year.

“So we don't have anything to prove this weekend. I don't feel like I have anything to prove. Just here to have some fun.”

Asked if it had felt strange to see George Russell racing his car in Bahrain last weekend, Hamilton praised the job that the young Briton did.

“I think George did an amazing job, and I think everyone knows that. I think it was definitely odd. And from my 27 years of racing, I've never missed a race. So yeah, one day, I'll write a book about it. But as I said, I'm just grateful to be back.”

Norbert Haug, former Vice President of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport, has commented on the controversial ending of the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, labelling it as "stolen" from .

The former journalist was instrumental in bringing Mercedes-Benz back into the motorsport fold in 1993, where the brand once again joined Formula 1 after a nearly 40-year absence from the sport. He facilitated partnerships with the likes of  and Sauber, and under his leadership, the team saw substantial success.

, the brand which supported Hamilton from a young age in his racing career, has been a substantial part of the racer's life, with him using Mercedes powertrains throughout his entire F1 campaign. Seven championships, 105 wins, and 202 podiums later, the Briton is moving to  in the hopes of winning his eighth world championship—something that Haug is "very sad" to see.

Despite Hamilton leaving the Silver Arrows, the former Mercedes boss has high hopes for him.

“It’s actually very sad for me, I have to say," he said in discussion with Sky Germany. "I would never have thought that Lewis would switch again.

“I’ve really known him since he was 14 years old. There really is still a great relationship. I hadn’t seen him for years… and I don’t know. When you’ve worked with people, with racing drivers, for so long, it’s like the first day, as if the last meeting was yesterday.

“Anyone who thinks that he will give up at 40 and step on the gas less and work less intensively will be wrong. He will give everything [at Ferrari]. I absolutely trust him to deliver the maximum possible performance in the race.

“And if the car is good, why shouldn’t it work out with the eighth title?”

A deflated Hamilton finished the hybrid era with disappointment as  won the Abu Dhabi race after a tense and exciting season. With Nicholas Latifi crashing at Turn 14, the race was looking to end under the safety car while the  was extracted.

The laps wound down and a Mercedes win looked inevitable, but race control allowed only specific cars to un-lap themselves, creating a fiery controversy. The race was restarted with one full lap left with Verstappen immediately behind Hamilton and on much fresher tyres, meaning he swept past him and won the race.

“The last few years [have been difficult] since the title we lost in 2021,” Haug admitted.

“And that really was a stolen title – there’s no other way to put it – due to the wrong safety car decision at the time,  but there was a demolition after that.

“The car and the team that preceded it suffered many setbacks, including last year. The victories that did come were some at low temperatures.”

With the championship battle between F1’s top two teams having gone to the wire in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, tensions between Red Bull boss Christian Horner and  chief Toto Wolff erupted as the season neared its end.

The level of animosity between the pair spilled over at times to them getting involved in clashes in FIA press conferences or in the media.

While the pair did shake hands during a final meeting in Abu Dhabi, the controversy over the safety car restart in the finale, and the protests lodged by Mercedes after the race, highlighted that things were still not completely settled between the two squads.

Speaking as he collected a prestigious Lorenzo Bandini Award in Italy on Tuesday night, Domenicali said one thing that F1 needed to address for next year was not letting the fallout of this season fester.

Instead, he felt it important that Mercedes and Red Bull mended their relationship for the good of the sport.

Asked if he had any worries for F1 in 2022, Domenicali said: “Those who live with certainties mean that they sleep well!

“But we have many doubts and we have to face them. We have issues that will eventually have to be managed.

“We will have to evaluate day-by-day the relationship that must be recovered between Red Bull and Mercedes, to avoid the personal clashes that we have seen that serve no benefit.”

Mercedes remains upset about the FIA’s handling of the safety car restart in Abu Dhabi, which it believed was in breach of the rules.

While it has dropped plans for an appeal over the matter, it has vowed to hold the governing body to account in a commission that has been set up to look at the events.

F1 owners Liberty Media have remained silent so far on the fallout of that controversy, as it prefers to leave matters like that for new FIA president Mohammed ben Sulayem to deal with.

Speaking about the situation, Domenicali said: “We have already spoken with the president. We talked about the priorities he will have to face, and there are many.

“But, at this stage, it is right to remain silent so as not to create further controversy in an area that was very overheated. But I would like to say that we come from an extraordinary season, followed by more than two billion people.

“The last Abu Dhabi GP was the most followed sporting event in 2021. These are stratospheric numbers that we must be proud of.”

Domenicali reckoned, however, that Sulayem’s arrival at the FIA would lead to a change of dynamic for the governing body.

“With the change of presidency within the FIA ​​there may also be a change in the balance within the FIA, which for us has an absolutely fundamental role.”

DATE: 2021

As part of the rules aimed to help F1 get through the financial difficulties triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, teams were forced to carry over their 2020 chassis in to this year.

However, they were allowed to make limited upgrades – which were restricted to the spending of two tokens that were weighted depending on how significant a part of the car was involved.

was , as it kept its development plans close to its chest.

Current chief technical officer James Allison said: “There are some parts of the car that you can change token-free, for example the power unit, the cooling systems, the suspension and of course all of the aerodynamic surfaces.

"We have spent our tokens, but we won't reveal how we used them just yet. That'll become clear in good time."

But with the team having secured the constructors’ championship, it has now emerged that Mercedes never did actually get around to spending its tokens officially.

Mercedes technical director Mike Elliott has confirmed: “For us, I don't think we actually ended up spending the tokens.

“We had ideas of things we wanted to do around the front of the car. The reality was we had ideas of stuff we wanted to do, but they didn't come to fruition in the end.”

Motorsport.com understands that a combination of the timing of the homologation deadlines, a late rule change from the FIA and  conspired to prevent the team spending them where it wanted to.

As part of the token spend rules for 2021, teams had to make decisions in July 2020 and inform the FIA of where they planned to change any homologated components.

So, by the July 22 deadline, Mercedes had made the call to spend its tokens on an upgraded nose that it believed would improve the car’s aerodynamics.

However, in the wake of the British Grand Prix tyre failures in August, the FIA wrote to teams after the race to inform them that it wanted to make a further step in aero regulation changes for 2021 to cut back on downforce even more.

This included greater restrictions on the floor dimensions, plus changes to the lower bargeboard area –

Aware of the implication of the changes, and how they would hurt the low rake cars more than the high rake models, the most obvious solution then would have been for Mercedes to alter its gearbox to help it raise the rear ride height to overcome the consequences.

However, this was not possible because the homologation restrictions had already forced teams to commit to any gearbox changes just five days after the end of the 2020 shutdown in June. So it was too late to go down that route.

Mercedes was instead locked in with its original plan to spend tokens on its nose, which it had opted for when it was not aware of the full implications of changes to the 2021 rules.

However, its plans for the nose ultimately changed when the consequences of the rule changes were made clear during a particularly difficult pre-season testing programme.

Elliott confirmed that it was the overall loss of downforce, rather than any particular balance problem with the car, that was its main concern during early running.

“I think when you've got a car that's dominant, which we've had previously, the balance you've got doesn't really matter so much to the drivers,” added Elliott. “So I don't think the issue we had at the beginning of season was so much balance, I think we just lost of lot of aerodynamic performance overall.

“Whether that hit us as hard as it hit other people, that's always impossible to judge because we don't know what the impact was on the other cars.

“All we know is by the time we'd done our work over the winter and turned up at the tracks, the sort of the advantage we had in the [2020] season, certainly advantages we had mid-season, had disappeared.”

Well aware of the work needed to recover, and with restricted wind tunnel time and the implications of the cost cap, Mercedes decided that it was better off focusing its 2021 efforts on sorting the basic package to overcome the downforce losses triggered by the new rules rather than pursuing the new nose.

That decision meant the plans for the nose were quietly shelved – so Mercedes never got around to running it and spending its tokens.

Despite the difficulties the team faced, Mercedes recovered to secure the constructors’ championship at the final round of the season, with  just missing out on the drivers’ crown thanks to the late race safety car restart in Abu Dhabi.

DATE: 2021

Traditionally, the sporting director has been the sole point of audio contact between the pit wall and race control should the need for communication arise during races.

This year F1 and the FIA agreed to broadcast selected conversations between the teams and Michael Masi for the first time in order to give fans extra insight.

As the season has progressed both Wolff and Red Bull team boss Christian Horner have on occasion taken over from their respective sporting directors Ron Meadows and Jonathan Wheatley and used the communication channel in an attempt to influence decisions in race control, and both were active in the closing stages of the Abu Dhabi GP.

Horner called for the lapped cars between in front of  to be allowed to unlap themselves, while Wolff made his feelings clear after the controversial move, having earlier asked that there be no safety car when  stopped on track.

After the race F1 managing director Ross Brawn suggested that team bosses should no longer be allowed to use the race control channel.

“I agree with Ross,” Wolff said when asked by Motorsport.com if he shared the same views as Brawn's. “But I equally blame Ross and myself because we have been part of the decision making to broadcast more of the channels for the purpose of transparency and entertainment for the fans.

“There is so much going on on the intercom that giving fans a little bit of an overview of all the little dramas that happen, like is the car breaking down, are we having some kind of strategy discussions, was meant well. But I think we overshot.

“I need to take myself by the nose, and Christian. We were given the opportunity to talk to the race director directly, and because we fight so fiercely for the interests of our teams all of us overstepped.

“It certainly was part of the failures this year that under pressure from the team principals also the race director’s life wasn’t made easier, certainly.”

Wolff suggested that not only should team principals be banned from talking to the race director but there should also be limits on what the sporting directors can do.

“We need to come back," he said. "I think team principals shouldn’t speak directly to the race director, it should be the sporting directors. I will go one step further and say I don’t think sporting directors should be lobbying race director or exercising pressure.

“They should be pointing to situations that the race director or his colleagues might not have spotted, but not lobby, not pressurise.”

DATE: 2021

They naturally saw the process as the last chance for the outcome of the 2021 world championship to be turned around, and they wanted to see justice done. As such there’s a widespread feeling on social media that  let the fans down, or that the team has been silenced by some kind of deal with the FIA.

So why did the team chose not to pursue its appeal? It comes down to two main factors. There was a indeed a conversation with the FIA, but only insofar as the governing body agreed to launch a full investigation that will come up with answers that the team wants.

And secondly, team principal Toto Wolff and his colleagues recognised that, however strong they felt their case might be, they were not going to win it – and there would be no change to the result of the race and thus the championship.

Rather than push on with an inevitably messy process that could damage the sport and the image of Mercedes, it was decided to call a halt to proceedings.

“After the race, I called Jean Todt and [FIA secretary general] Peter Bayer and said that I didn't agree with this decision,” Wolff explained on Thursday. “Of course I knew that it was purely a personal emotion, because we had to sort out the legal remedies and whether we could protest at all, or against what. And we did that immediately in my office.

"We got all the engineers, lawyers, Ola [Kallenius, Daimler chairman], just all together and decided to file this protest. Ron Meadows and the team went to see the stewards twice, at the invitation of the stewards. And then we waited for the decision, which was negative.

“And then it was a matter of going back to the hotel and sulking, or thinking about what had happened. Or, on the other hand, to celebrate an eighth constructors' title with the team. And that's what I did - trying to push aside the frustration about the decision that cost the drivers' world title, until the next day.”

Filing a notice of intent to appeal bought the team 96 hours during which to consider its options. The deadline was Thursday evening – by co-incidence the same time as the FIA prize giving, where Verstappen was due to get his trophy.

“We've spent all the last few days being in dialogue with the FIA, with Lewis and Ola and his colleagues to make the right decision,” said Wolff.

“And we've vacillated over and over again in those days between, 'We're going to go through with this appeal' and 'We're going to pull back despite all the anger and just try to make the sport better and use this moment to just make the decision-making more robust'. The final decision to withdraw the appeal was made on Wednesday evening.”

Asked if in the aforementioned dialogue with the FIA any admission by the governing body that mistakes was made, Wolff stressed that it hadn’t, which is no surprise.

“I think it is very difficult in such a situation to compromise your legal position. And I think for the FIA it wasn’t clear if we would go all the way with the appeal, and therefore you cannot expect any admission. I think they have taken the right step.

“The president has convinced the World Motor Sport Council to set this commission in place, to look at the incidents of the Abu Dhabi race, and to avoid any such situations going forward. All of us welcome that decision. I don’t think it was easy. The statement of the FIA, when you understand the nature of the governing body, is a strong and robust one.

“Obviously as a racer you would wish full admission, but that is not possible at that stage. I think we have taken a stop in the right direction. It is a modest step, considering the magnitude of the failures on Sunday night, but better a modest step than not.”

The bottom line is that Mercedes thought that it wouldn’t win at the International Court of Appeal, and in suggesting that Wolff in effect criticised the sport’s judicial system, which was a bold claim to make in public.

“We believe we had a very strong case, and if you look at it from the legal side, if it would have been judged in a regular court you could almost guarantee that we would have won. But the problem with the ICA is the way it is structured.

“The FIA can’t really mark their own homework. And there is a difference between being right, and obtaining justice.

“So there is a lesson to be learned, how can we make sure that going forward in situations like that that the right decisions are being taken, the verdicts from stewards are a response to the regulations, and judgement in the courts – whether it is the ICA or the CAS [Court for Arbitration on Sport] which is not currently part of the legislation – can be judged in a way that is fair and neutral to every participant.”

Wolff stressed that Hamilton was personally involved throughout the process: “Every step on the way it was joint decisions. We decided together with Lewis to protest, to launch the appeal, and to withdraw the appeal.

“As you can imagine, not only for him, but also for us as a team, it was terrible to be confronted with a decision that decided the outcome of the world championship.

“But nobody of us, neither him or us, want to win a world championship in the courtroom. But on the other side, we were deeply wronged on Sunday. And it wasn’t just a case of a bad call, it was a freestyle reading of the rules, and it left Lewis like a sitting duck. It was tremendously hard for him and for us as a team to withdraw the appeal, because we were wronged.

“And we deeply believe that in F1, the pinnacle of motor racing, one of the most important sports in the world, justice is being done. So my soul and my heart cries with every bone that this should have been judged in the right way, and the legal situation would have given us right. But there’s a difference between being right and obtaining justice.”

Wolff has sympathy with Hamilton fans who believe that Mercedes should have pressed on with its case, and have expressed their thoughts on social media.

“I can understand the frustrations of many," he said. "And to be honest, I have the same. I am also in two minds, all the time, between my perspective and my judgment on the legal position, and my realism about the outcome of such proceedings.

“As I said before, there's a difference between being right and obtaining justice. And I don't think that at the moment, we are set up in terms of our governance to end up in a situation that would have given us remedy, that would have reinstalled the result that was taken away from Lewis before the last lap of the race. And that's why heavy-hearted we have decided not to appeal because we wouldn't have gotten the result back. Now I think we have the right tools in hand to make sure that the decision making going forward is better.

“And we will be holding the FIA and the decision makers accountable for making the sport more robust and the decision making more robust and more consistent.”

All eyes will now be on the FIA as its newly elected president Mohammed Ben Sulayem takes on the job of setting up and overseeing the commission that was suggested by his predecessor.

No details have emerged of what form it might take, but Wolff says it has to do a proper job. And having withdrawn the appeal in part as a response to its formation, Mercedes will no doubt try to ensure that it does.

“I expect the commission to not only come up with words, but with actions,” said Wolff. “And we will hold them accountable for the actions. Because we cannot continue in a sport that is meant to be sport followed by entertainment, and not the other way around, [where] we are held ransom by ad hoc decisions in every field - in technical and sporting.

“And therefore there need to be clear measures in place before the start of the season, so every driver, every team and the fans understand what it is on, and what is not on.”

He stressed that it’s not just about Abu Dhabi, but the bigger picture: “It is a wider problem, because if you look at most of the controversies that have happened this year, it was about decisions.

“Sporting decisions on the track, inconsistency of the execution of the regulations on track. It’s one thing to drive hard, and to have differences of opinion among the drivers, and among the teams.

“It is in the nature of the game. But inconsistent decision making leads to controversies, leads to polarisation, and that was the grounds for many of the totally unnecessary controversies on the track.

“So the FIA needs to decide how they are going forward. We had a good dialogue with the FIA over the last few days.

“The commission that it has set in place I have trust and faith that we will formulate, together with all of our competitors and the drivers and the other teams the right decisions and actions to avoid such a scenario in the future.”

DATE: 2021

Wolff remains angry about Masi's handling of the safety car restart in the closing stages of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, which opened the door for  to grab the victory he needed for the crown.

The team believes that Masi's choice to select which backmarkers could unlap themselves, as well as the timing of the restart, were a clear breach of the regulations.

A protest lodged on Sunday night by  was rejected by the stewards though, and on Thursday the team announced that it was withdrawing its appeal over the matter as it welcomed the FIA setting up a probe into the events.

Although remaining deeply unhappy about what Masi did, Wolff says that the response needed now from the FIA goes far beyond just what the Australian did in the final minutes of the race.

Reflecting on the impact of Masi's decisions and what should happen now, Wolff said: "I am not interested in having a conversation with Michael Masi.

"The decisions that have been taken in the last four minutes of this race have dropped  from a deserved world championship. His driving, particularly in the last four races, was faultless. He had a commanding lead on Sunday in Abu Dhabi from the get-go.

"He won the start and he never gave the lead away again. Robbing him in the last lap of the race is unacceptable.

"That is why, from a personal standpoint, from a professional standpoint I cannot… my values and my sense of integrity just isn't compatible with the decisions that have been made on Sunday.

"So it is up to the FIA to decide going forward how these decisions, how these situations, can be avoided."

Wolff was clear that he had no problem at all with Verstappen being champion, as his gripe was entirely directed at the FIA.

"I would have been totally OK with Max and Red Bull winning the championship on Sunday, and this situation is nothing to do with Max,"said Wolff.

"He is a worthy champion. His driving is exceptional and Red Bull are fierce competitors. I have the greatest respect for the people working there, so this has nothing to do with them.

"I would love to sit here and avoid all these discussions and the damage that has been done to the sport, by just integrity and sporting and fair decision making on Sunday.

"So the FIA needs to decide how they are going forward. We had a good dialogue with the FIA over the last few days and the commission that has been set in place.

"I have trust and faith that we will formulate, together with all of our competitors and the drivers of the other teams, the right decisions and actions to avoid such a scenario in the future."

Wolff said Mercedes has vowed to hold the FIA to account over its promises to learn lessons from what happened in Abu Dhabi, and says the team will not accept the matter being brushed under the carpet.

"I expect the commission to not only come up with words but with actions, and we will hold them accountable for the actions," he said.

"We cannot continue in a sport that is meant to be sport followed by entertainment, not the other way around, and we are held ransom by ad hoc decisions in every field, in technical and sporting.

"So therefore there needs to be clear measures in place before the start of the season, so every driver, every team and the fans understand what it is on and what is not on."

Asked why he had faith that the FIA will make the right changes and own up to its mistakes, with the governing body having blamed fans and media for 'misunderstanding' things and having previously kept details of an investigation into Ferrari's engine in 2019 a secret, Wolff said: "I think in a day and age of transparency such decisions cannot be made any more in backroom deals.

"And why I am optimistic is that most stakeholders in the sport will share my frustration on the decisions that have been made all throughout the year.

"Everyone who is a racer, you guys, us, knows what happened. So nevertheless I have confidence because we will all be pulling on the same rope and in same direction.

"The teams, and I have had feedback from the teams and from the drivers and I have assurances from [the FIA's] Peter Bayer and [F1 CEO] Stefano [Domenicali] that in the next weeks and months we will close the gaps that have opened up more and more over the last few years."

Hamilton was on course to take an eighth F1 drivers' title until the final five laps of the Yas Marina climax to a hotly contested 2021 season, which tipped the race on its head and allowed  to clinch his maiden title.

Although  protested the results and appealed the decision to throw that protest out, the team has since elected to withdraw its appeal.

Wolff explained that both he and Hamilton would struggle to overcome "the pain and distress" following the race, but hoped that the disappointment of losing the title in such a controversial manner would not push Hamilton towards the exit door.

"Lewis and I are disillusioned at the moment," said Wolff. "We are not disillusioned with the sport, we love the sport with every bone in our body and we love it because the stopwatch never lies.

"But if we break that fundamental principal of sporting fairness and authenticity of the sport, then suddenly the stopwatch doesn't become relevant anymore because we are exposed to random decision making. That is clear that you may fall out of love.

"And you start to question if all the work you have been putting in, the sweat, tears, and blood can actually be demonstrated in bringing the best performances on track, because it can be taken away randomly.

"We will never overcome the pain and the distress that was caused on Sunday.

"I would very much hope that Lewis continues racing, because he's the greatest driver of all times," Wolff added.

"He, when you look at it from the point of view of the last four races, he dominated them on Sunday, there wasn't even a doubt who won the race. And that was worthy of winning the world championship.

"So we will be working through the events over the next weeks and months. And I think as a racer, his heart will say I need to continue because he's at the peak of his game.

"But we have to overcome the pain that was caused upon him on Sunday, also, because he is a man with clear values. And difficult to understand that it happened."

Wolff added that Hamilton was part of both decisions to appeal and withdraw it, adding that neither wanted to secure a championship title "in a courtroom".

He said that the team found it incredibly difficult to withdraw the appeal, feeling that the team was dealt a cruel hand by "freestyle" interpretations of the sporting regulations during the Abu Dhabi race.

"Every step on the way it was joint decisions," Wolff explained.

"We decided together with Lewis to protest, to launch the appeal, and to withdraw the appeal. As you can imagine not only for him but also for us as a team it was terrible to be confronted with a decision that decided the outcome of the world championship.

"But nobody of us, neither him or us, wanted to win a world championship in the courtroom.

While  has elected to  of the late-race safety car restart in the F1 season finale, the German car manufacturer remains deeply unhappy about the way the events were handled.

Mercedes had already elected not to send its championship-winning F1 and Formula E cars to Paris for pre-gala photographs, and it has now been confirmed that neither Hamilton nor Wolff will attend.

Speaking to media on Thursday, Wolff said that the squad would be represented to pick up its constructors' championship trophy by its chief technical officer James Allison.

"Both of us won't be there," explained Wolff, when asked if he or Hamilton would be travelling to Paris for the end of season event.

"I won't be there because of my loyalty to Lewis and because of my own personal integrity.

"But we will be represented as a team by James Alison, who will be taking the trophy on behalf of all the people in Brackley and Brixworth who should celebrate our eighth consecutive world championship title, who deserve to be celebrated, because it's a fantastic achievement that we are very proud of."

Wolff admitted that he found it hard to balance the joy of Mercedes winning its eighth constructors' championship against the fury he has with the way the FIA's decisions in the closing stages cost Hamilton the drivers' crown.

"In a way I'm trying to compartmentalize the anger on the outcome of the F1 drivers' championship and, on the other side, the pride and the joy of having achieved something unprecedented and that needs to be celebrated."

Hamilton's absence from the FIA prize gala is a breach of F1's sporting regulations, which makes it mandatory for the top three finishers in the championship to attend.

Article 6.6 of F1's Sporting Regulations states: "The drivers finishing first, second and third in the Championship must be present at the annual FIA Prize Giving ceremony."

It is unclear whether or not the FIA will impose any sanction on Hamilton for not going to the event.

In a short statement issued on Thursday, the team said it welcomed a move by the FIA to investigate the events from last weekend so no longer felt it needed to push on with its action.

had been left angry about the way in which F1 race director Michael Masi had selectively chosen some backmarkers be allowed to unlap themselves and had rushed the safety car restart.

The team claimed that, had Masi followed the rules explicitly, then the GP would have finished under the safety car and  would have been champion.

Mercedes duly protested the result, but its case was rejected by the FIA stewards, who reckoned there had been no rules breach. They claimed that separate regulations gave Masi total authority to do as he pleased with the safety car.

After lodging a notification of its intent to appeal, Mercedes had until Thursday evening to decide whether or not to push on with the case.

But with the FIA having announced on Wednesday evening that it was launching a probe into the events of the Yas Marina circuit, Mercedes felt that it better it focus on improving the rules than batting to change the result.

In a statement presented as a letter to fans, Mercedes made clear it was hard to comprehend the circumstances of what happened in the closing stages of the race on Sunday.

"We left Abu Dhabi in disbelief of what we had just witnessed. Of course, it's part of the game to lose a race, but it's something different when you lose faith in racing," it said.

"Together with Lewis, we have deliberated carefully over how to respond to the events at the Formula 1 season finale.

"We have always been guided by our love of this sport and we believe that every competition should be won on merit. In the race on Sunday many felt, us included, that the way things unfolded was not right."

Mercedes went on to explain that it will hold the FIA to account over its probe that will look into events and make improvements to its rule book and procedures for the future.

Dear Formula 1 community and fans,

We left Abu Dhabi in disbelief of what we had just witnessed. Of course, it's part of the game to lose a race, but it's something different when you lose faith in racing.

Together with Lewis, we have deliberated carefully over how to respond to the events at the Formula 1 season finale. We have always been guided by our love of this sport and we believe that every competition should be won on merit. In the race on Sunday many felt, us included, that the way things unfolded was not right.

The reason we protested the race result on Sunday was because the Safety Car regulations were applied in a new way that affected the race result, after Lewis had been in a commanding lead and on course to win the World Championship.

We appealed in the interest of sporting fairness, and we have since been in a constructive dialogue with the FIA and Formula 1 to create clarity for the future, so that all competitors know the rules under which they are racing, and how they will be enforced. Thus, we welcome the decision by the FIA to install a commission to thoroughly analyse what happened in Abu Dhabi and to improve the robustness of rules, governance and decision making in Formula 1. We also welcome that they have invited the teams and drivers to take part.

The Mercedes-AMG Petronas team will actively work with this commission to build a better Formula 1 - for every team and every fan who loves this sport as much as we do. We will hold the FIA accountable for this process and we hereby withdraw our appeal.

To  and : we would like to express our sincere respect for your achievements this season. You made this Formula 1 Championship title fight truly epic. Max, we congratulate you and your entire team. We look forward to taking the fight to you on the track next season.

And lastly, even though this Drivers' Championship did not end the way we hoped, we could not be prouder of our team.

Lewis, you are the greatest racer in the history of Formula 1 and you drove your heart out for every lap of this incredible season. You're a flawless sportsman on and off the track and you delivered a faultless performance. As a pure competitor and as a role model for millions around the world, we salute you.

Valtteri, you have been such an important part of this team, delivering five Constructors' Championships in five seasons. Thank you for your remarkable contribution to our motorsport history. Kiitos, Valtteri.

Finally, to every one of the skilled and passionate women and men of the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team in Brackley and High Performance Powertrains in Brixworth: you've written an historic chapter in the Silver Arrow story by winning the eighth Constructors' Championship - in a row. This is an unprecedented achievement. In simple words: it's awesome. You are awesome.

Russell featured in both days of the post-season running at the Yas Marina Circuit this week, driving a modified  W10 from 2019 to sample Pirelli’s 18-inch tyres for 2022.

It marked Russell’s first outing for Mercedes since his stand-in appearance for  at the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix, when he came close to winning on debut for the team.

Mercedes announced in September that Russell would be joining full-time for 2022, stepping up after three years with  to replace the outgoing .

“It’s a strange feeling, because I’ve tested with the team numerous times after races, end of season, and here we are again,” Russell said after his first day of testing in Abu Dhabi.

“But obviously it’s my first time as an official driver for the team. It was a really great day to be back with the guys, and learning about the new tyres.

“It’s always a pleasant experience driving a world championship-winning car, the 2019 Mercedes, and with these 18-inch Pirellis, which seem to be reacting pretty positively. It was a nice day.”

Teams were permitted to field their modified mule cars on both days of testing in Abu Dhabi, giving them a chance to get to grips with the new tyres, which are part of the overhaul of the technical regulations for 2022.

The new 18-inch tyres are a marked change from the current 13-inch tyres, with smaller sidewalls giving them different characteristics.

“It felt pretty nice to drive, to be honest,” Russell said of the new 18-inch tyre.

“It’s going to be very different next year, as the cars are going to be drastically changed compared to these current cars. So there’s not an awful lot you can take away from it.

“Nevertheless, they do react pretty differently to the 13-inch tyres that we’ve raced on previously.

“Let’s hope that carries through to next year and see how they react with the new regulations.”

One struggle Russell faced when he replaced Hamilton in Sakhir last year was fitting in the cockpit, forcing him to wear race boots one size too small to get his feet inside.

Russell joked he was “a bit battered and bruised” after driving the modified 2019 car on Tuesday in Abu Dhabi.

“It’s pretty damn tight in that car, but next year will be much better and I’ll have a bit more room to breathe,” he said.

“I’m looking forward to that. But you suck it up, get on with it, and I’ve got all of Christmas to recover.”

continued its record streak of constructors' championship victories by clinching an eighth title on Sunday in Abu Dhabi, ending the season 28 points clear of Red Bull. It marked a fifth constructors' win for Bottas to end his fifth and final season for Mercedes.

Hamilton was passed on the last lap of the race by  after a controversial restart that led to two protests from Mercedes, which has since stated its intent to appeal their dismissal.

While Bottas was glad to have helped Mercedes clinch another constructors' title, he admitted the overriding feeling post-race was disappointment.

"I'm really proud that we got the constructors, but obviously drivers' championship is a big thing," Bottas said immediately after the race in the written media pen. "I haven't seen the team yet. But I'm sure it's the same feeling, that is not quite like we won today. I think we lost today."

Bottas added: "Every year I've been with a team, we've won the constructors'. So I guess I've had to do something! So that's good.

"But still, the overriding feeling now is disappointment for Lewis. But I'm sure once you give me a few days that we'll see the positives.

"In any case, that's it now for me and Mercedes and for this chapter, and now it's for something new. From this weekend, learned a lot and we move on."

Bottas ended the year third in the drivers' championship with one race win and 10 further podium finishes, leaving him 36 points clear of  in the second Red Bull car.

While he felt the team would "need a few days" after Hamilton's title defeat, Bottas was sure the magnitude of its achievement to win the constructors' would not be lost.

"It is, it is important, and for sure, we appreciate it more after," Bottas said. "It's been impressive. For me, five years in a row winning constructors is a big thing. But I'll appreciate it more in the if you asked me on Thursday or Friday."

Bottas made his first appearance for  on Tuesday in the post-season Abu Dhabi test, but will not formally part company with Mercedes until the end of the year.

DATE: 2021

filed two protests with the FIA stewards at the Yas Marina Circuit over the race restart after  passed  on the final lap of the race to win the world championship.

The stewards dismissed both protests, including one of the resumption of the race with one lap remaining, but Mercedes has confirmed it has lodged its intention to appeal the decision.

“We have lodged our intention to appeal Document 58 / the decision of the stewards to dismiss the team’s protest,” said a Mercedes spokesperson after the race on Sunday.

It means Mercedes now has 96 hours to decide if it will continue with its action and formally lodge an appeal with the FIA’s International Court of Appeal.

Mercedes said in the hearing that race director Michael Masi had not followed the sporting regulations by resuming the race with one lap to go as the full restart procedure had not been completed, with not all of the lapped cars being allowed to pass the safety car.

But the stewards threw this out, claiming the article of the regulations Mercedes based its case on had been overriden by the call for the safety car to come in at the end of the lap.

It was the second protest to be dismissed by the stewards on Sunday night, after Mercedes also claimed that Hamilton had been overtaken behind the safety car by Verstappen. This dismissal is not subject to the intention to appeal.

Red Bull F1 boss Christian Horner said after the race that the team “never wanted to end up in front of the stewards” after the championship had been decided, and called the move “desperate”.

Asked prior to confirmation of Mercedes’ intention to appeal if Red Bull could still celebrate tonight, Horner said: “If they appeal, they appeal.

“We’ll fight it in the appeal court and then in a legal court if they were going to go down that route.”

The FIA issued a final race classification at 12:06am local time in Abu Dhabi, but noted it was “subject to an appeal lodged with the ICA”.

DATE: 2022

topped the times at the Spanish Grand Prix venue with what was an early development phase package, an achievement that required significant ride height changes and metal floor stays not originally designed to be run nor considered legal under F1’s original technical rules to be added.

But Shovlin, Mercedes’ director of trackside engineering, has revealed that although the team’s issue with porpoising had been spotted at its shakedown run during Storm Eunice two weeks earlier and continued at Barcelona, it was not overly concerned because the W13 was yet to run in its race specification.

That specification arrived to great intrigue at the Bahrain test ahead of the season opener, with the car transformed thanks to its ‘zero-pod’ sidepod design (the floor stays remaining and subsequently declared legal by the FIA with several squads using them to the end of the season).

But here Mercedes’ 2022 campaign unravelled as the W13’s porpoising got even worse and could not be solved until the team introduced its first major upgrade at May’s Spanish GP.

Afterwards it was revealed that Mercedes also had a problem with suspension stiffness over bumps, even though its aerodynamic issues with porpoising had been addressed.

This secondary problem and the work to improve it meant the Silver Arrows team could not make the W13 quicker through additional developments until the Austin race late in the season.

“At Silverstone [for the shakedown], we were in the middle of a storm – it was about the worst conditions we’ve ever run a car in,” Shovlin told Motorsport.com.

“That certainly doesn’t allow for very clear and sensible shakedown running for the filming day.

“But that car – so the car that we then took to Barcelona – yes, you could get porpoising and we were running the car very high anyway on ride heights given the weather and given that it was the first running of the car.

“We did lower the ride heights to more normal levels at Silverstone and saw that you could get this phenomenon. But, we didn’t really know much about it and what was causing it.

“So, going to Barcelona was therefore a case of understanding: ‘How can we run the car? What are the problems? How can you mitigate what was happening with the porpoising?’

“At the time about the best thing you could do was just lift the car off the ground, give up performance and manage it that way.

“That car was defined much, much earlier in the development programme than the race one package.

“But the issue… at the time in Barcelona, we thought: ‘We’re not the quickest, but we don’t think we we’re in a bad place’.

“Because we were expecting to add good performance with that Bahrain package.

“The issue was that when we fitted it, the porpoising was a whole other level.

“Most of the performance that we intended to add didn’t materialise because we had to lift the car even further and at that point you couldn’t get rid of the bouncing.”

DATE: 2022

Shortly before factory staff disappeared for the Christmas break,  hit its target of getting the W14 fired up at Brackley before the holidays.

In a short video published by Mercedes, the team teased the firing up of the car – but made sure to reveal no clues about potential changes to its design.

Mercedes is coming off the back of a disappointing F1 season, where it failed to win a world championship title for the first time since the turbo hybrid era began in 2014.

The W13 suffered from excessive porpoising and it took the squad much of the year to get to the bottom of the issues.

Towards the end of the season the team was much more on top of what it needed to do, and a final push of updates from the United States Grand Prix helped it eventually claim a 1-2 finish in Brazil.

The W13 stood out from its rivals in having a ‘zero-pod’ concept, but its main Achilles heel was that it had been designed to produce maximum downforce as close to the ground as possible.

That choice proved unworkable in the real world, thanks to the impact of bumps and porpoising with the new ground effect models. Mercedes has duly had to change tact.

It is expected to make a much larger overhaul of its concept for next season, which could also include a revision of its sidepod design.

Speaking recently, Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said analysis of what had gone wrong with the W13 had prompted a change of direction for the team in 2023.

“The DNA of the car is going to change for next year, that’s clear,” said Wolff.

“It doesn’t necessarily mean that our bodywork is going to look very different. But certainly what is part of the DNA of the car, the architecture of the car, will change for next year.”

Mercedes will retain the same driver line up next year, with  and  being teammates for the second successive season.

saw its streak of eight consecutive constructors’ championship victories come to an end this year as it struggled to get to grips with the new technical regulations.

The team was blighted by a porpoising issue through pre-season testing before deeper problems with the W13 car emerged in the early part of the season, leaving it well behind  and Red Bull in the battle at the front.

But Mercedes managed to develop the car in a direction that allowed it to remedy many of the problems and regain performance, allowing it to win the penultimate race of the year in Brazil.

Its recovery has left Ferrari driver Leclerc confident Mercedes will be back in the thick of the fight at the head of the pack next year, setting up a possible three-team fight along with Red Bull.

"I do believe that Mercedes will be in the fight,” said Leclerc, who scored three wins this year for Ferrari. “Another team? I haven't seen signs yet maybe to believe that another team will join the top three.

“But Mercedes will definitely be there next year with a very strong car. We've seen how much they've improved from the first race to the last race.

“I think they understood what they did wrong, and this is normally the sign that it will go better.

“So hopefully it will be a three-team fight next year.”

Ferrari managed to hold on for second place in the constructors’ standings ahead of Mercedes despite going on a winless run from the Austrian Grand Prix in mid-July until the end of the season.

The Italian team spent the early part of the year evenly matched with Red Bull for performance, winning two of the first three races, only to lose ground as the year wore on.

But Leclerc expressed his confidence that Ferrari would be able to learn from its struggles through 2022 and get on top of them in time for the new campaign starting in Bahrain next March.

“I am confident because we are doing quite a lot of work at the simulator,” said Leclerc. “We’ve been working extremely hard in the past year to try and understand what were the weaknesses of this car in order to get better for next year’s car.

“I also think that after the 2021 season, where we've been working very well and reset it a little bit from 2020 that was a difficult season, we have been working in the right direction and in the right way.

“This gives me the confidence that we'll have a competitive car for 2023.”

After a run of eight successive constructors’ championship titles since 2014,  found itself on the back foot with last season's new W13, which struggled with porpoising and a lack of performance.

The opening phase of the year was especially difficult, as the squad lost weeks of development time trying to get to the bottom of what had gone wrong with its design.

After several false starts, where it had appeared to unlock the answers before falling back again, Mercedes finally got on top of matters in the closing phase of the campaign to win the Brazilian Grand Prix.

Shovlin, who is Mercedes’ trackside engineering director, says that while the turnaround was impressive the season was far from fun at times.

However, he reckons that a mindset instilled in it during the glory years was critical in allowing it to knuckle down when things went wrong.

“It's difficult to look at the year and be very satisfied. It has been tough,” he said. “But the culture in the team, I think, has helped us come through, and we never got carried away with our own success.

"We were quite quick to adapt to the reality that we were suddenly racing in the mid-grid, from having years where we go to every race with a chance of being on pole and winning it. And I think we dealt with that quite well.”

While Mercedes chiefs kept their chin up in public over the early struggles, Shovlin confesses that there were difficult periods that had to be endured.

“There were moments that were quite uncomfortable,” he said. “The team, and the owners have high expectations, and we knew that the early part of the year was nowhere near acceptable by our standards.

“But the team is now in good position to go into next year and challenge.

"The thing that we always said was we'd focus on the learning not the winning. We were determined to try and make progress in that regard. And we did seem to get ourselves into a decent position.”

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director, Mercedes AMG Press Conference

While dealing with the troubles was not a fun experience, Shovlin does believe that the depth it had to go to to understand what worked with the new ground effect cars could give it an edge going forward.

“In reality, we spent three months where we did very little development and it was all about learning and knowing what we needed to do,” he said.

“In the final races we were bringing updates, and we've been running everything that we've been making. So I think it probably did help us.

“I think if we could choose between the two, we'd have always chosen for rolling out with a race winner and deal with it. But honestly, I think this year has been good for the team.

“We knew that you can't win everything forever. And we knew that a year like this was always going to be there. The test was always well, when we get that year, how do we go?

“So I think it has been interesting. We've learned a lot. Whether we made the most of it will be determined next year.”

After winning eight constructors' titles in a row,  endured a tricky campaign through 2022 as it struggled to match Red Bull and  under the new regulations.

Drivers  and  were hindered by a porpoising issue through the early part of the season, but as the team moved to fix the problem, deeper problems with the W13 car became clear.

It was able to get on top of the problems by the end of the season and avoid a winless year as Russell took victory in Brazil, but has made clear it plans bigger car changes for the W14 model in 2023.

Teams faced the added challenge of developing their new cars under the $140 million budget cap for 2022, forcing them to be more considered about what areas to focus on for development.

But Wolff said that having no budget cap "wouldn't have made a difference" in solving the W13's issues during the season, believing it was simply a process that could only be done gradually.

"We're not lacking the capability, or we weren't lacking any of the tools, nor time," Wolff said on F1's Beyond the Grid podcast.

"It was more that we needed to peel off layer by layer in order to get to the ground of the problem. So it wouldn't have changed anything."

Mercedes initially thought it had remedied the porpoising issue with its first major update of the season, brought to the Spanish Grand Prix, after both Hamilton and Russell showed encouraging pace.

But the porpoising problem returned soon after and was even present in a small amount at the season finale in Abu Dhabi.

Wolff explained that Mercedes could not solve all of the bouncing problems with the W13 car, but that the team thought it was "going to be easier next year."

"We are changing some of the architecture and the layout of the car that should point us in the right direction," said Wolff.

"But as it is with these new regulations, sometimes you uncover one problem and then you realise there was another underneath.

"We have to stay humble and not feel a sense of entitlement that we're going to get back into this championship and win straight from the get-go. I'm really looking forward to it."

After losing his seat with Haas at the end of the 2022 season and ending his association with , Schumacher has linked up with  - the team his father, Michael, last raced for in F1 - ahead of the new year.

The role will see Schumacher join Mercedes trackside at all races through 2023, as well as conducting extensive work in the team’s simulator to support race drivers  and .

Mercedes was open in its interest in signing Schumacher as a reserve driver for 2023, with team principal Toto Wolff confirming in Abu Dhabi that he was eager to hold talks, leading to a deal being agreed.

“I am thrilled to be part of the Mercedes team as their reserve driver for 2023, and I am committed to give it my all to contribute to their performance in this very competitive and professional environment,” said Schumacher.

“I take this as a new start, and I am just excited and grateful to Toto and everybody involved for putting their trust in me. F1 is such a fascinating world, and you never stop learning, so I look forward to absorbing more knowledge and putting in all my efforts for the benefit of the Mercedes team.”

Wolff added: “Mick is a talented young driver and we’re delighted to have him join the Team. He is a hard worker, has a calm and methodical approach and is still hungry to learn and improve as a driver.

“These are all important qualities, and we’re excited for him to help us develop the W14. We also know that with two years of experience racing in Formula 1 under his belt, he will be ready to step into the car at short notice to replace either Lewis or George, should that need arise.”

Schumacher lost his seat with Haas after a difficult second season in F1 that saw him struggle to match team-mate  for form.

He recorded a best finish of sixth in Austria, one of two points finishes during the season, but it was not enough to save his seat as Haas turned to  for next year.

Mercedes managed to take a big step forward in performance late in the season, aided by a development package that arrived for the United States Grand Prix in Austin.

The team initially thought it had made a breakthrough in Spain, when it appeared to have curbed its porpoising problem, only for further issues to emerge that have prompted a change in approach to the car’s DNA for next year.

“I think we much better understand what the problems were,” reflected Wolff.

“We’ve been peeling onion layer after onion layer off, discovering more issues and more problems. But I think we’ve come to a point that we understand pretty well why the car is not performing.

“As I said before, the correlation is there for some tracks. So it’s all in the fine detail of how can we make the car work aerodynamically, how can we improve the ride, and make it more stable as a basis.

“It’s multiple factors that contribute to a car that is simply just not good enough, and I think if we are able to sort that out over the winter, at least we can provide a stable platform to the drivers, we can develop it from there.”

DATE: 2022

The German car manufacturer went completely its own route for 2022, adopting a ‘zero sidepod’ solution on the W13, which was very different to the downwash Red Bull idea and the inwash  concept.

But while  endured difficulties with its 2022 challenger, the team remained adamant that its  solution.

And, with its key focus being on curing the porpoising problems that blighted the start to its campaign rather than worrying about the sidepods, changes it made to most other aspects of its car eventually helped turn its car in to a winner.

Mercedes trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin said that the team never felt that it needed to focus too much effort on the sidepod solution as it was not triggering a big performance deficit.

Plus, he pointed out, the team has always known that the best route to success in F1 was to push on with its own ideas than simply copy others.

“Most of the engineering, certainly from the aerodynamic point of view, a lot of it are the bits you can't see under the floor,” said Shovlin. “That is where a lot of that work is.

“The sidepod concept was something that we had to commit to anyway for the year realistically. But if we'd been more focused on just trying to find a quick fix, we may have been copying and rolling it out and seeing what it does.

“The goal for us though was always to try and understand it ourselves and learn and find our own path, because if you want to win, and you want to win races and world championships, you don't get there by copying everyone else's design.

“All our other cars have had pioneering features on them, they had clever ideas. We have tried to be leading with the technology, so we'll carry on doing that.”

Despite sticking steadfast to its sidepod solution for 2022, Mercedes could yet make a switch for next year as it ponders a rethink of its car concept.

Red Bull’s sidepod design was not the only thing that grabbed attention this year, because it was the team’s low-drag concept – which helped deliver impressive top speed – that gave it a big advantage over the course of the campaign.

Shovlin said that Mercedes, which suffered from high drag, was aware of the characteristic, but was not obsessed with simply boosting straightline speed potential in 2023.

“When you've got a completely new set of rules, it's difficult to know where everyone is going to design to,” he explained.

“Their car looks like it has less drag if we put the same wings on it. In the earlier part of the year, we were having to run very high [downforce levels], which was certainly not helping from that point of view.

“But if you look at Brazil, we didn't have the fastest car, but we could overtake them and we were able to get the 1-2. So making it quick in a straight line is not our highest priority. And one of the fastest in a straight line is the . So it doesn't define your performance level.

“But when you are very similar, obviously, it's a nice advantage to have. So it's something we'd like to fix. It's just that the priority will always be the base performance of the car and getting that in the right place.”

Mercedes managed to address most of its porpoising problems over the course of the campaign, but still encountered a few issues later in the season.

Shovlin says he is mindful of the problem returning as the team adds more downforce to the car over the winter, but he reckons new floor edge rules will also help it overcome some of its most obvious problems.

“The more you load up the floor, the more you can trigger those problems,” he said. “Where we have made very good progress is in the straightline. So back in Imola, Jeddah, Bahrain, all those early races, the car was bouncing really badly at high speed. And we managed to get a really good handle on that.

“There were still issues we got when the car rolled in a fast corner and the floor gets to a point where it's touching. And that can cause a bit of unsteadiness. But the rule changes for next year will help that.

“Fundamentally, though, they're not going to make the problem go away. They'll make it a bit easier for the teams. But we're hopeful that the work we put into the learning and the understanding in the early part of the year will help us at least develop to a good baseline next year.”

DATE: 2022

Wolff and Binotto went head-to-head on a number of issues while heading up their respective teams over the past four seasons, particularly through 2019 amid concerns about the legality of ’s power unit.

Ferrari announced  and would leave Maranello at the end of the month, ending a 28-year stint with the Scuderia. The news has left one of the most high-profile jobs in F1 vacant, with Ferrari saying it would finalise a replacement in the new year.

Speaking on F1’s Beyond the Grid podcast,  team principal Wolff said it was “no secret” that he and Binotto “had our moments” in recent years, but felt they had been “consolidated” through 2022.

“We were in a much better place,” said Wolff. “But it was always clear that he was under tremendous pressure. Being a team principal at Ferrari, you better have a good contract for your exit.

“Now, probably the unavoidable happened, but he held onto it longer than I thought.”

As well as being Ferrari’s F1 team principal, Binotto was also its technical chief after taking up the role in 2016. Prior to that, he oversaw Ferrari’s engine division, giving him one of the most expansive CVs in the paddock.

Asked if Binotto’s experience and pedigree would ever make him of interest to work at Mercedes, potentially overseeing its High Performance Powertrains arm, Wolff ruled out the possibility.

“No, I think there was too much porcelain broken between us the last two years that this would be possible,” said Wolff.

“With the other teams, I can’t say. But certainly Mattia understands Formula 1 inside out, and yeah, maybe he finds a role in another team.”

Alfa Romeo's Frederic Vasseur has been tipped as Mattia Binotto's successor at Ferrari.

Frederic Vasseur, the team principal of , is the current favourite to take over at Ferrari, but Wolff felt it was “very difficult to judge” who would be the right fit for the role.

“You need to understand motor racing, maybe more than just Formula 1,” Wolff said.

“But it’s such a niche where the sport, the regulations, the governing body, the commercial rights holder, the competitors, all of us are basically locked in this paddock cage. You need to be politically astute.

“It’s a very niche, specialist environment. The more you know about the sport, the better it is. But you don’t want to be a one-trick pony either.

“You can be a good racing manager, and not understand about anything that's going on commercially or outside in the world.”

DATE: 2022

For the first time since the turbo hybrid rules were introduced in 2014,  failed to win either a drivers’ or constructors’ championship this year.

But with F1 history books often showing that dominant teams can spend years in the doldrums once they are finally beaten, Mercedes knows that there is a risk this year’s dip in form may not be a one-off.

However, Wolff says that the close analysis it has done of why other top teams faded away shows that Mercedes could escape the fate of others.

He suggests that other teams often suffered thanks to the departure of senior staff or drivers, or a change of engine partner.

With Mercedes still retaining the top personnel that have guided it to recent success, Wolff believes that there is no major cause for concern right now.

Speaking about stopping the kind of decline other top teams have faced, Wolff said: “Of course, we are talking about it. We are analysing what were the reasons in the past that teams that dominated over an era suddenly lost performance. And you can trace it back pretty well.

“Change of regulation; people leaving; a tyre that changed fundamentally. We have the same organisation, the same capability, the same financial funding. And I believe we have things in common and we can trace it back.

“We are aware of all that and the regulation changed. We got it wrong. But all the other pillars are still in place. And we have to tune the systems, and understand.”

Wolff believes that other teams took so long to recover because they needed to make fundamental changes to their organisations – something he thinks Mercedes does not have to do.

But equally he is mindful that things can move quickly if Mercedes finds itself on the back foot.

“You can see that with , as an example, I mean they lost the whole top leadership and the key driver,” he said. “I think that is something where you can trace it back.

“With Red Bull it was a fundamental situation that the power unit regulations changed upside down and no works deal basically. So it was fundamental parameters changed.

“But we are looking at that and thinking: we better be careful. We better be careful because the season has gone by in a heartbeat. And we can't let that happen, to look back after the next season and the one after.”

DATE: 2022

As part of its punishment for breaching last year’s cost cap, Red Bull was handed a $7 million dollar fine and a 10 percent reduction in wind tunnel time as part of F1’s Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions.

The extra loss of wind tunnel running will mean Red Bull is heavily compromised compared to , which gets a lot of extra running as the result of finishing third in the constructors’ championship.

According to F1’s Sporting Regulations, Red Bull as constructors’ champions should have been allowed 70 percent of the full wind tunnel running, which equates to 224 runs.

Second-placed  should get 75 percent and 240 runs, with Mercedes on 80 percent and 256 runs.

But as the result of Red Bull’s drop, it will now only get 63% of the allocation and 202 runs.

This means Mercedes gets approximately 27 percent more wind tunnel allowance and wind tunnel runs.

Speaking about the challenges of closing up the gap to Red Bull this winter with the F1 cost cap in place, Mercedes boss Toto Wolff reckons the aero testing deficit could be something that makes an impact.

Asked if a recovery was more difficult now that there was a spending limit, Wolff said: “I think it's harder because you can't really invest more in order for the outcome to come quicker.

“But I think how the aerodynamic regulations are designed, and the penalty that they've gotten, it's 25 percent less wind tunnel and that can have an effect,” said Wolff.

“The way that the regulations, the ATR restrictions, have been set in place means there are teams that are further back who can really make a big jump compared to the front runners.

“That's also the reason why we will see much closer championships in the future because if you are last, you will have 40 percent more.

“So, clearly that is an advantage that you have to utilise. Is it a given that we can utilise it? Who knows?

“They [Red Bull] are a brilliant racing team. It will give them an extra motivation and against Ferrari, it's seven percent. But it's around marginal games and we have been a bit closer to Ferrari in the last quarter of the season.”

Mercedes was held back this year by pausing development of its W13 as it chased cures for the car’s early season porpoising problems.

But once it got on top of the core issues, it was able to make rapid improvements and managed to dominate the Brazilian Grand Prix weekend, with  winning both the sprint and main grand prix.

Asked if the strong end of season form had left Mercedes confident it would be back in the fight at the front next year, Wolff said: “I'm never confident.

“I'm a glass half empty guy, and kind of never believe that the job that we're doing is good enough. I'm not sure at all whether we can bounce back to a position where we compete for championships, because you need to acknowledge that the competition is strong.

“But we will do everything in our power, everything, to set our objectives high and try to reach them.”

DATE: 2022

The German car manufacturer is coming off the back of the first season since 2013 where it has not won at least one of the world championship titles.

But while 2022 fell short of expectation, and delivered it fair share of headaches at times with the tricky W13, Wolff says it has been a much easier experience to live through than the controversial way Mercedes saw Lewis Hamilton lose the drivers’ championship 12 months ago.

Asked by Motorsport.com about which of the last two seasons was more painful, Wolff said: “Last year without any doubt, because last year was strong. And how it ended, within a couple of seconds, we knew that that's it.

“It's out of control; out of your hands. And losing control, that was the first time since I was an adolescent. And, in my sense of fairness, that was totally against my values.”

Wolff thinks that it has been easier to accept things this year because the lack of performance has been entirely its own responsibility.

“This year was not as peaky, in terms of the emotions, because we knew from the get-go at the beginning that the car was just not good enough,” he added.

“I think we understood it slowly but surely. We would peel one layer of the onion off and you think you solved the problem, but then it is the next one and the next one.

“Then we started to correlate where this car, that was really not a good one, could perform. And we tried to concentrate on these tracks, knowing that the more difficult ones like Abu Dhabi were, in a way, damage limitation.

“So it was our doing. Last year Abu Dhabi wasn't our doing. We knew we got it wrong. We're conscious that others did a better job. And this is an absolute meritocracy, how this season ended up. So that is okay.”

This season was the first since Hamilton entered F1 in 2007 that he failed to win a grand prix.

But while breaking his streak, and finishing the year 35 points behind teammate George Russell was not ideal, Wolff thinks Hamilton’s greatest achievements have come off track.

“I think he's been really, really good this year,” explained Wolff. “You would expect a world champion that has had the title taken away from him, to come in and just try to smash everybody. But we didn't give him a good enough car to do that.

“He's held us up at times with his energy level, when it goes down, up there in the briefing room, and on days where it was difficult for him.

“That particular [win] record, I don't think that it matters a lot. It is more about helping to set the sails for next season.

“The partnership with George was really good, and they together developed the car.

“For me, knowing him [Hamilton] for 10 years from a personal side, and a human side, exceptional. Exceptional, better than all the performances he had in the car. For me, his attitude and mindset this year was outstanding.”

DATE: 2023

Formula 1 teams are well underway preparing for the forthcoming 2025 campaign, which will consist of 24 grands prix beginning in Melbourne on the 14-16 March.

The grid is set and all but two teams -  and Aston Martin - have changed their driver line-up, meaning this year will have a new look.

But it is not just the full-time competitors that play a crucial role, as a team’s back-up driver does as well.

Reserve drivers act on standby during grand prix weekends and may contest one should a team’s regular driver be unable to. This happened at the 2024 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, for example, as .

F1 teams also employ simulator drivers, who test changes made to the car so that everybody can gain a greater understanding of the machine.

So, who are the drivers supporting their team behind the scenes for 2025?

Liam Lawson served as Red Bull’s reserve driver at the start of the 2024 season, but then .

. This means Red Bull is currently without an official reserve driver, though Lawson’s former team-mate Yuki Tsunoda is expected to step into the role.

Meanwhile, Rudy van Buren will continue as Red Bull’s simulator test and development driver after joining in 2023.

, but in a reserve driver capacity having been ’s team-mate from 2017 to 2021. The 10-time grand prix winner left for  - now  - having been replaced by George Russell, who was previously at  after graduating to F1 as a Mercedes junior.

But the Swiss outfit opted for an all-new line-up this year ahead of its Audi takeover in 2026, leaving Bottas without a drive. So, in December 2024 Mercedes announced that the Finn was back with the Silver Arrows replacing former reserve Mick Schumacher, who is part of Alpine's Hypercar programme.

Sharing the role with Bottas is the 2023 F2 championship runner-up Frederik Vesti, who started the position last year having become a Mercedes junior in 2021.

, having been part of its academy between 2015 and 2018. He initially left to become Renault’s development driver in 2019 before making his F1 debut with Alfa Romeo in 2022 but, like Bottas, he was dropped by the Hinwil-based outfit for this year.

He will work alongside , who was Zhou's predecessor at Alfa Romeo. The Italian became Ferrari’s reserve driver in 2022 and Giovinazzi also competes for the historic brand in the World Endurance Championship, where he won the 2023 Le Mans 24 Hours.

Regarding Ferrari’s development drivers, that includes Arthur Leclerc who joined in 2024. He is the younger brother of full-time Ferrari driver  and is joined by  and Davide Rigon.

McLaren is yet to announce who its reserve drivers for 2025 are, with previous incumbent . But Arrow McLaren IndyCar driver Pato O’Ward has previously contested F1 practice sessions for the Woking-based team, so it is likely he will continue his commitments.

McLaren also employs , who spends a lot of time in the team’s simulator where he works closely with the engineers and regular drivers.

Aston Martin has retained Felipe Drugovich and  as its reserve drivers for 2025. Previously the team was able to call on the reserves of engine partner Mercedes in case of an emergency but in more recent years, Aston Martin has introduced its own reserve drivers.

While Vandoorne joined from Mercedes in November 2022, Drugovich has graduated from the Aston Martin driver development programme and the 2022 F2 champion has worked with the squad since 2023.

Jack Doohan will contest his first, full campaign in F1 this year after serving as Alpine’s reserve driver in 2024 before replacing  at the Abu Dhabi season finale.

As a result, Alpine has announced Paul Aron, Ryo Hirakawa and Franco Colapinto as its reserve drivers for 2025.

Aron had a stellar F2 campaign last year, finishing third to champion Gabriel Bortoleto and Isack Hadjar, while Hirakawa has joined from McLaren where he held a similar role.

There is more hype around Colapinto though, who made his - relatively unexpected - F1 debut in Monza 2024 having replaced Logan Sargeant at . He impressed immediately finishing 12th before taking points at his second grand prix in Azerbaijan with eighth.

But Williams had already announced  as ’s team-mate for 2025, so there was no full-time seat for Colapinto. As a result, , where a spot may soon open up for the young Argentine given Doohan’s unsecure future.

Williams does not currently employ its own reserve driver, as previous incumbent Colapinto has left for the same role at Alpine after impressing for the British squad in his nine-round stint last year.

Jamie Chadwick, meanwhile, serves as its development driver after joining Williams in 2019 which is the year she clinched her first of three W Series titles.

Hadjar served as Racing Bull’s reserve driver last year, when it was known as . But following Lawson’s promotion, Hadjar will partner Tsunoda for his rookie season leaving Racing Bulls currently without an official reserve driver.

Considering its close ties with Red Bull though, the Faenza-based squad can call on whomever is in the Red Bull pool.

Zane Maloney and Theo Pourchaire have left the Sauber set-up since acting as reserve drivers last year. The Swiss outfit is yet to confirm who will support its all-new line-up of  and Bortoleto before the squad morphs into the Audi works team in 2026.

Haas is also yet to announce its reserve driver for 2025 having promoted previous incumbent Bearman to a full-time seat at the American squad. One option could be Pietro Fittipaldi though, as the grandson of double world champion Emerson joined the team in 2019 and in that time has started two races due to ’s crash at the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix.

This resulted in a large-scale update arriving in Monaco with further adaptations being implemented throughout the remainder of the season.

Let’s take a detailed look at some of the car’s finer details in full, and how that big development programme was rolled out to overtake  for second place in the Constructors’ Championship.

Mercedes W13 and W14 side comparison

A comparison of the W13 and W14, showing how the zeropod’s inlet had been pushed back for 2023.

Mercedes W14 brake detail

A look at the front brake assembly without the drum in place gives us a glimpse of the collar used to hold some of the internal fairings in place.

Mercedes W14, floor detail

A close up of the forward portion of the W14’s floor, including the mini-scroll section with a row of vortex generators housed on it and a perforated Gurney arrangement above it, while aft of that is the taller scroll section of the edge wing with a divisible strake on the surface.

Mercedes W14 technical detail

Beneath the covers of the W14 we’re able to see how the radiators and ancillaries are package around the power unit and sidepods.

Mercedes W14 steering wheel detail

The back of the  steering wheel shows a single wishbone paddle gearshift lever at the top and an elongated single paddle clutch arm runs across the bottom, which is fitted with a finger socket to help modulate the release.

Mercedes W14 front wing

Mercedes continued to employ a variation of the open-ended front wing flap and endplate juncture in 2023, although it also included two new winglets above the rear elements.

Mercedes W14 middle wing detail

Having pushed the zeropod’s inlet further back, the side impact spar (SIS) wing fairing became more of an independent surface.

The W14’s rear brake assembly without the drum in place allows us to see how the caliper is fed cool air by its fairing.

A look at the W14’s diffuser, with the mouse house visible in the sidewall and the trumpeted upper corner. Also note the stepped lower edge on the rear brake duct winglet.

A close up of the bib wing, with the flexible material used to allow that section to move up and down when it comes into contact is also a notable feature.

Mercedes W14 front detail

A massive update arrived at the Monaco Grand Prix, which not only resulted in the W14 having a more ‘traditional’ sidepod design thereafter but also saw the upper wishbone realigned.

An off for  at the Monaco Grand Prix led to the W14 being craned away from the circuit and provided us with a rare glimpse of the underfloor, which is full of complex geometries.

A much larger cooling gill panel was installed for the Spanish Grand Prix to help keep temperatures under control.

Mercedes W14 nose and front wing detail

A rare glimpse of the nose and front wing assembly from beneath.

Mercedes W14 new front wing comparison, British GP

A new front wing arrived at the British Grand Prix and featured revisions to the mainplane and wing tips in the outer section, a more cambered endplate design and a more aerodynamically shaped slot gap separator bracket.

Mercedes W14 front wing detail

A top-down overview of the new front wing design, with most of the details changed at the outboard end of the wing.

Mercedes W14 rear wing end plate

Mercedes introduced an open-ended endplate variant at the Hungarian Grand Prix, altering the size and shape of the rear endplate cutout.

Mercedes W14 suspension detail, Hungarian GP

The lead arm of the front suspension’s upper wishbone was modified again for Hungary, with a dipped profile added to the fairing (red arrow).

Mercedes W14 sidepods detail, Belgian GP

The vortex generating fins and mirror stalk slat were removed for the Belgian Grand Prix to reduce drag, while the scrolled section of the edge wing saw the strakes attached to it reduced from three to two.

Mercedes W14 rear wing comparison

Mercedes tried different rear wing configurations at the Belgian Grand Prix to find the right balance for their drivers, with an infill panel for the endplate and no Gurney on the trailing edge of the upper flap employed on ’s car, while Hamilton’s car was set up with a lower downforce wing, endplate cutout and a Gurney on the trailing edge.

is set for a name change in 2024 after its current title sponsorship will come to an end. The team is expected to change its name to the Sauber brand for 2024, before its transformation into the Audi works team in 2026.

Red Bull’s junior team  will also face a name change in 2024, with the team wanting to return to a non-branded name like it’s previous Toro Rosso guise. Although the rebrand is yet to be announced there is rumours the team could be called Racing Bulls.

Although there are not many massive changes heading into 2024, a new record-breaking 24 race calendar will make this the biggest year ever for the championship.

Here’s everything you need to know about the 2024 F1 season:

There are no changes to the 2023 F1 grid as we go into the new season. Every team has stuck with the drivers that they ended the season with, but many contracts set to expire at the end of 2024.

Daniel Ricciardo has also secured his place at AlphaTauri after the team axed  midway through 2023. Speculation that Sergio Perez could also lose his place at Red Bull following a difficult mid-season has been dismissed, which includes rumours that Ricciardo could be moved into the team next year.

Although the grid is not changing from the latter half of the previous season, 2024 could prove more interesting with 13 out of 20 seats up for contention at the end of next year.

F1 teams have begun to announce the dates for their 2024 car launches ahead of the new season. Pre-season testing begins on 21 February (two days earlier than 2023), so it is expected that teams will reveal their cars slightly earlier than the last season. In 2023, cars were launched between 31 January and 16 February.

Here are the F1 car launch dates for 2024:

30 August–1 September

29 November–1 December

The 2024 F1 season will begin on 29 February and will see a record-breaking 24 race season. The calendar has been regionalised by the FIA in an attempt to make the series more sustainable, including moving the Japanese GP to April from its usual September spot for a more defined Asian leg.

The Chinese GP will make its return to the F1 calendar after being cancelled for the last four years. The Qatar GP will become the penultimate race of the season, which should help with the heat issue faced by drivers in 2023 but will also make transportation of cars and equipment to the Abu Dhabi finale easier.

F1’s pre-season testing for 2024 will begin on 21 February in Bahrain. There will be three days of testing for the teams ahead of the first grand prix the following week.

The FIA has also revealed that pre-season testing will run each day between 10am to 7pm, instead of the previous 7:30pm which happened in 2023.

The testing sessions will take place in Bahrain to help with the FIA’s conscious efforts to make the series more sustainable. This means the cars and equipment will not need transporting between pre-season testing and the first grand prix of the year.

Testing will run between 10am and 7pm after the FIA reduced the timings down from 7:30pm.

The FIA has made some changes to regulations around the testing of old cars, stipulating that any components run must have been previously used at a race weekend.  has been revised to state: "Cars must only use components and software of a specification that have been used in at least one (1) Competition or TCC (testing of a current car) of a Championship season."

The regulation change will ensure that teams cannot run any brand-new components on an old car to try and gain any date outside of testing restrictions.

The F1 teams have begun to announce their 2024 reserve drivers for the upcoming season. Some of the teams have retained their 2023 reserve drivers including Red Bull rookie Liam Lawson and Mercedes’ Mick Schumacher.

However some teams have decided to bring in brand new drivers, including McLaren who have announced two new drivers to their line-up. The team has announced it will sign this year’s 24 Hours of Le Mans winner Ryo Hirakawa and IndyCar driver Pato O’Ward as reserve drivers for the next season.

The  duo notably made contact during qualifying for the Spanish Grand Prix and then crashed at Turn 1 in Qatar, for which Hamilton (who was eliminated)

Hamilton also appeared reluctant to follow a strategy call in Japan, with the team asking him to slow to give DRS to Russell to help him fight off ’s  in the closing stages.

Russell said these flashpoints are “normal” when the pair are evenly matched - they drew 11-all in the 2023 qualifying head-to-head - and that means they meet frequently on track.

Asked about the comings together by Motorsport.com, Russell replied: “I think it’s normal when you’re so close in performance, when you’re lapping at the same lap times or you’re starting next to one another on the grid - you’re always going to be close.

“We always go through our strategies [in] meetings. The pace difference between the two of us is zero.

“We’re always going to be going across a 24-race season, an average of 60 laps per race, we cross paths a lot and he’s the driver I cross paths with the most.

"So, I think that’s probably what we put it down to.”

Russell underlined that the two “trust one another” to leave enough room on track even when it may be tense between them and that the Qatar crash was down to a “small misjudgement”.

He continued: “I think also we trust one another. There may be tense [moments], it may be hard, but we trust one another.

“We know that we’ll give each other enough space to fight necessarily and not go beyond the limit.

“Obviously, Qatar was just a bit of a lap one small misjudgement. That’s another opportunity where it was another podium or even a potential victory missed.”

Russell, who finished eighth in the standings as Hamilton ranked third, reckoned 2023 was the “toughest season I’ve ever had psychologically”.

But his mistakes, Russell believes, are down to pushing himself harder than ever as he is not content to be level-pegging with Hamilton.

Russell added: “I’m purposely trying to push myself further and beyond.

“I’m not satisfied with just being on par with my team-mate in qualifying or whatever it may be.

“Or last year [when] we were very even across the whole season. I want to be ahead.

“That’s what I’m pushing myself for. Perhaps that’s been a small reason for contributing to a couple more mistakes.”

Verstappen will be reportedly charged over €1.2 million to for the superlicense he needs to compete again next year.

The three-time world champion won 19 of the 22 races in 2023 which, with licenses increasing in cost for every point a driver scores, will result in a massive charge from the FIA.

Thankfully for Verstappen, the hefty fee for next year won’t be paid by himself, as he revealed: “The team pays that, fortunately.”

He told Dutch broadcaster Viaplay: “I do think there should be some normal ratio in that. But you know, things like that get written down, and I don’t think anybody expected that there would end up being that many points scored.”

Red Bull is the only team to confirm they will pay the superlicence fee for Verstappen and it is not known whether his team-mate  or other drivers will have to pay their own fees.

Verstappen finished the season with 575 points in 2023, which is the most points ever secured by a driver in a season. However, Verstappen’s dominance has left the driver with an eye-watering cost to ensure he can drive next year.

The Dutchman had previously branded the costs as “absurd” where he added: “I don’t think it’s right that we have to pay so much. It’s not the case in other sports either. And there are more and more races.”

Fortunately for Red Bull the driver salaries and fees are not included in the FIA’s budget cap which ensures teams limit spending and gives a more level playing field to each team.

Team principal Christian Horner also told Viaplay: “I mean, it’s a luxury problem to have because we’ve had to score the points to generate the invoice. Thankfully, it’s outside of the budget cap. But yeah, it’s a big cheque to be writing to the FIA.”

An FIA superlicence is the highest type of licence available and is a mandatory requirement by any driver who wants to compete in Formula 1. The licence is awarded to drivers by the F1 governing body, the FIA.

The superlicence was first introduced in the 1990s, but a governing age was added in 2015, following Verstappen’s debut in 2015. Verstappen was 17 years and 166 days old when he first made his F1 debut, with the FIA adding the rule to prevent potentially unsafe and inexperienced drivers from competing.

Drivers must complete a series of requirements to be rewarded their superlicence, including being at least 18 years old when they would first compete in F1, hold a valid driving licence and pass an FIA theory test of the F1 sporting codes and regulations.

Those who have held a superlicence for the previous three seasons are still eligible to apply for a new one if they plan to make their return to F1. This means that drivers such as , who was dropped from  in the first half of the 2023 season, could reapply for their superlicence and make his F1 return in the next few years.

The mandatory superlicence reportedly consists of a €10,400 base figure that every driver must pay to ensure they can compete in the following season. There is also a reported additional charge of €2,100 for every point scored in the season that has just passed.

Verstappen secured 575 points in the 2023 season which comes with a staggering additional cost to the drivers superlicence, with each point achieved costing the driver an additional €2,100. Having scored 575 points in 2023, Verstappen’s licence fee is sat at €1,217,900.

Here’s the full list of how much each driver will reportedly have to pay for their 2024 superlicence:

According to these numbers, the total figure that the FIA will receive from F1’s drivers in 2024, to allow them to race, is €5,380,200.

DATE: 2023

After the two squads that fought for the 2021 world titles ended up racing in very different parts of the F1 pecking order at the start of the new ground-effect era, there was much expectation that  – along with  – might be able to close the gap to Red Bull’s new position as the championship’s dominator.

Both teams eventually adopted Red Bull’s downwash sidepod concept as the end of the 2023 campaign’s first half approached, but Horner told Motorsport.com in an exclusive interview at the Abu Dhabi season finale that his team had been surprised to see Mercedes and Ferrari had not taken that approach during the winter.

When asked if his team had been left feeling positive when Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff announced that his squad would be abandoning the W13/W14 car concept with the ‘zeropod’ sidepods at 2023’s first race, Horner replied: “Well, Toto tends to be a little dramatic anyway.

“I think what surprised us was that Ferrari had a very good car last year. And the natural evolution of that we expected it to be a very tight contender this year.

“We were very surprised to see Mercedes sticking with the concepts that had clearly failed the previous year.

“If you looked around the cars in pre-season, the cars that were closest in concept to us were the Aston Martin and .”

Horner also insisted Red Bull only began to feel it had the best chance to win both F1 world titles for the second season in succession when  won in Melbourne.

The Australian event was one where Red Bull was comprehensively defeated by Ferrari’s  in 2022 and so to do the reverse to all its rivals one year later, Horner said it provided his team with the confirmation it had been seeking about its overall chances for the year ahead.

“Certainly, coming out of Bahrain, we felt like, ‘we've got a really good package here’,” he explained. “But we didn't know whether it was circuit specific – temperature, conditions, asphalt.

“So, it's only when you've had a sample of two or three and you've gone to a couple of circuits that have been more troublesome, certainly for us the previous year, like Melbourne for example, that suddenly you're thinking, 'ok, no, this is really together'.

“And so yeah, it takes a sample of a few races to get a clear overview. Nobody was coming out of Bahrain getting too carried away.”

DATE: 2023

Last week  between a team principal and FOM employee, amid dubious allegations that  boss Toto Wolff and his wife Susie, who runs the F1 Academy for FOM, had exchanged confidential information.

Less than 48 hours later the matter was dropped as the FIA  to prevent unauthorised disclosure of confidential information, but , who said they had their reputation harmed by the public nature of the probe.

Wolff's  counterpart Vasseur feels the whole saga was “quite embarrassing” and unnecessary as the FIA managed to clear the Wolffs shortly after going public with the probe, which suggests there was no need to issue a public statement in the first place.

“I think this story is quite embarrassing for our sport,” Vasseur said when asked by Motorsport.com if he was worried by the incident and its implications on the already frosty relationship between FOM and the FIA.

“The story started with an article in a newspaper, I don't know if newspaper is the right word. And I think in this situation when you are speaking about an individual, you have to take care of what you are saying.

“I think it would have been appropriate from the FIA; they needed 24 hours between the [first] announcement and the second announcement. It would have made sense to use the 24 hours before the first announcement [to investigate], to avoid any bad conclusions."

The probe was launched amid suggestions that rival teams had complained about the Wolffs to the FIA, but one day later  and denying they were behind the probe.

Vasseur pointed out that if anything good had come from the whole saga, it was that all 10 teams were united on a certain topic, which is a rare occurrence in F1.

“After the 'incident' of last week at least the teams were very united,” he added. “The first conclusion for me is that we were able to act together and it's not very often that even  was supportive of Toto! [Vasseur laughs]

“And honestly, I think it's a good point for us also to take position and to discuss with the other stakeholders. I think it's the first time the teams together showed something like this.”

out-qualified  team-mate  yet again in the season finale, which meant the 27-year-old finished the F1 season as the only driver to have out-qualified his team-mate for every race in 2023.

Sargeant struggled in his rookie campaign with Albon always proving superior, but other driver pairings were much closer. So how did each driver compare to their team-mate in the 2023 F1 season?

Arguably one of the most one-sided pairings in 2023 was Red Bull, as Verstappen proved too much for Perez. The triple world champion clinched the title with six grands prix to spare and set many records in doing so.

One record was for the biggest points gap to second in the championship, with the margin bigger than the total points Perez amassed across 2023. While Verstappen was consistently claiming the race wins, Perez often struggled for a podium finish despite Red Bull’s superiority over the rest of the grid.

Perez did start the season pretty well with two victories in the opening four races, as well as second in Bahrain. But from Miami onwards, Verstappen took it to another level leaving Perez to struggle and doubts to linger over his Red Bull future.

The pressure is on the Mexican to improve significantly in 2024, which is the final year of his contract.

Hamilton bounced back from a disappointing 2022 where Russell, in his first season at Mercedes, beat him in the standings and became the third team-mate of the seven-time world champion - after  (2011) and  (2016) - to do so.

But the roles reversed in 2023 and Russell said “this year the drivers’ championship has just been a complete disaster”. Hamilton, meanwhile, was one of F1’s best, being the highest-placed driver behind Red Bull’s pair in the standings with a pole position in Hungary his standout result.

Nevertheless, on the whole it has been a disappointing season for Mercedes who failed to claim a race victory for the first time since 2011. Much work is to be done if they are to improve on their second-place finish from 2023 and become world champions once again.

Crucial to that target is the drivers, who remain committed to the project having recently signed new contracts. Hamilton and Russell have a good relationship with much respect between the two, despite their collision in Qatar where the 38-year-old retired on lap one after turning in on his team-mate at the opening corner.

Leclerc and Sainz have been team-mates for three seasons now, yet it’s always close between the two. 2023 was a clear example of that as just six points separated both drivers in the championship going in the favour of Leclerc, but Sainz might be the happier one as it’s him who got the race victory.

Meanwhile, Leclerc often has the upper hand in qualifying, winning that battle 15-7 - including five pole positions compared to Sainz’s two. Things might be tight, yet 2023 was not their closest statistically as Sainz beat Leclerc in the 2021 championship by just five and a half points.

Norris comfortably beat former team-mate  in the championship for two consecutive years, so McLaren wanted closer competition in 2023. Piastri gave it exactly that as he impressed in his rookie season which earned the 22-year-old a new contract that expires in 2026.

While the head-to-heads ended at 17-5 and 15-7 to Norris in the grand prix and qualifying battles respectively, much of that was at the beginning of the year when Piastri was still trying to adapt to F1. Once he did, things were much closer.

Piastri out-qualified Norris in five of the 10 grands prix after the summer break, which included a victory in the Qatar GP sprint race, while a win of any kind in F1 still eludes the Briton.

was a much-improved team in 2023 as they jumped up to fifth in the championship after finishing seventh in 2022. This included eight podiums and three front-row starts, yet that was all done by Alonso who dominated team-mate Stroll.

While Alonso was often fighting for podium positions, Stroll was in the midfield, with the Canadian only achieving three top-five finishes - two of which came in the final three grands prix. But his seat is still secure for 2024 where he will hope to close the gap on Alonso.

Aston Martin also need to ensure its results remain consistent throughout a season. Its form tailed off towards the end of 2023 as six of Alonso’s podiums came in the opening eight grands prix, which left Aston Martin third in the constructors’ championship until they fell behind Ferrari and McLaren in the final 14 rounds.

There was very little to separate the Alpine team-mates in Gasly’s first season with the team, but Ocon could blame that on misfortune. He retired more times than any other F1 driver in 2023, much of which was down to reliability - his failed gearbox in Singapore being just one example.

This led to the drivers being matched head-to-head in race results, but Gasly comfortably beat Ocon in the qualifying battle. That might give Gasly extra satisfaction considering it’s against Ocon, who has been his rival since childhood.

There was much anticipation at the beginning of 2023 over how the two will fare as team-mates given their history - the two often collided when competing against each other as children in karting - but on the whole Ocon and Gasly have worked well together and things have not flared up.

That’s despite it being a disappointing season for Alpine, who finished sixth - two places lower than their position in 2022.

Williams very much had the most one-sided driver pairing in 2023. Albon really impressed this season with several point finishes and Q3 appearances, therefore showing why he is capable of leading the team forward.

Yet it was a different story in the opposite side of his garage. Sargeant struggled during his rookie season which is evident in the qualifying record versus Albon, while only beating him in three grands prix. However, those three occasions were because Albon retired so in races where both drivers finished the Thai-British driver was always ahead.

Sargeant did score a point, but it only came as a result of Hamilton and Leclerc being disqualified from the United States GP. Despite the struggles, Williams has retained Sargeant for 2024 so he should do much better in his sophomore year.

The team-mate battle at AlphaTauri is very messy given how many times the team changed its line-up in 2023. Beginning the season was Tsunoda and de Vries until the F1 rookie was dropped after 10 grands prix for poor performances.

De Vries left AlphaTauri having failed to score a point while at the time, Tsunoda had two. The 23-year-old comfortably won the qualifying battle as well, as de Vries struggled throughout his tenure with six bottom-five finishes including two retirements.

Ricciardo replaced de Vries for the Hungarian GP, which marked his return to F1 after leaving McLaren at the end of 2022. Ricciardo immediately had the better of Tsunoda by beating him in qualifying and the race at the Hungaroring, but the Japanese driver levelled both scores a week later in Belgium.

Yet Ricciardo then spent a lengthy time on the sideline, as he broke his hand during second practice for the Dutch GP. He returned two months later at the United States GP where things were once again tight between Ricciardo and Tsunoda.

In the final five grands prix, Tsunoda out-qualified and out-raced his team-mate on three occasions while scoring 15 points compared to Ricciardo's six. The two will remain team-mates in 2024, where there’s potentially a shot at a Red Bull seat for the following season.

While Ricciardo was injured, Red Bull junior Lawson stepped in to become Tsunoda’s third team-mate of 2023. Lawson, who finished third in the 2022 F2 Championship, immediately impressed coming close to points in Zandvoort and Monza before a ninth-place finish at the Singapore GP after he pulled off a shock Q3 appearance at Marina Bay Street Circuit.

Lawson then finished 11th in Japan, but was well out of contention in Qatar for his final grand prix. In terms of race results, he performed better than Tsunoda and was therefore touted for an F1 seat in 2024 but that did not present itself. Lawson will be the team’s reserve driver next year, but the expectation is that he will eventually be on the grid full-time.

Hulkenberg made his return to F1 in 2023 after losing his full-time seat with Renault at the end of 2019. Yet it was like he’d never been away as he beat team-mate Magnussen in the championship, while winning both race and qualifying battles quite comfortably.

That driver pairing was one to watch in 2023 due to their history together, where at the 2017 Hungarian GP Hulkenberg called Magnussen “the most unsporting driver on the grid” after being pushed off the track while attempting an overtake.

However, there was very little drama between the two in their first year as team-mates and they actually worked pretty well together. Hulkenberg and Magnussen have been retained by Haas for 2024, but they will be hoping for a more competitive car after the team finished bottom of the championship.

The 2023 F1 season witnessed mega dominance by  who continued its fine form from 2022, while many other teams had vastly different campaigns to the year before.

and  both moved up the championship order quite significantly, while  and  dropped down.

But many others were up and down, too. So how did each F1 team perform in the 2023 season compared to 2022 and were there any shocks on the grid?

*Wins, pole positions and podiums don’t include sprint races

Red Bull had a truly dominant 2022 season where it clinched the constructors’ championship with three rounds left, while  won a record-breaking 15 grands prix in a year. Considering such success, the question was how could Red Bull improve for 2023 - but that was something they managed to do.

The RB19 broke several records which arguably makes it the most dominant car in F1 history, where 21 grands prix wins helped Red Bull score over double the points tally of its runner-up .

Key to Red Bull’s dominance was once again Verstappen, who broke his own record for most wins in a season (19) plus many others to clinch a third consecutive drivers’ title.

Mercedes ended 2022 with big disappointment, as the Silver Arrows got its narrow sidepod design significantly wrong and saw a run of eight consecutive championships ended by Red Bull. But, statistically, 2023 was even worse despite Mercedes adding wider sidepods onto its car for Monaco, which was the season’s sixth round.

The team had its first winless campaign since 2011 while scoring less than half of their podium tally from 2022. Mercedes often struggled to find the ideal operating window for its car during a weekend with set-up sometimes changing from session to session.

However, there was still a positive moment as  took pole for the Hungarian Grand Prix during a year where the seven-time world champion delivered impressive performances en route to third in the championship, despite his car’s struggles.

It was a different story for team-mate , who finished eighth in the drivers’ standings with just two of the team’s eight podiums to his name.

Ferrari had a season to forget as it slipped to third in the championship scoring 148 points less than 2022. The Scuderia’s biggest struggle was excessive tyre wear and inconsistent race pace which left them 454 points behind world champions Red Bull.

This was made worse as they arguably started 2022 with the quickest car, as Ferrari began that year with a 1-2 in Bahrain and led the Austrian squad by 49 points after three races.

Since the Australian GP in April 2022 though, Ferrari has won just three grands prix and look very far from any kind of title challenge:  finished fifth in the drivers’ standings, while , whose win in Singapore was the only non-Red Bull victory of 2023, came seventh.

The turnaround McLaren had in 2023 was remarkable. It started the year as a backmarker with no points in the opening two races, but wholesale updates for the grands prix in July turned their fortunes around. What it caused was nine podiums, plus a sprint race victory, in the latter half of the 2023 season, which lifted McLaren up to fourth in the championship from sixth before the upgrades.

Another reason for McLaren’s revival was that it finally had both cars consistently fighting for higher positions. Rookie  replaced the struggling , who rarely challenged  in their two years as team-mates.

Norris scored 77% of McLaren’s points in 2022, which dropped to 68% in 2023 and helped them to challenge the likes of Ferrari and Mercedes - sometimes Red Bull even.

Aston Martin was one of the surprise packages in 2023, as it already surpassed its 2022 points tally after three grands prix. The British outfit started the season with the second-quickest car, as  consistently stood on the podium alongside both Red Bull drivers.

This came after very aggressive developments over the winter, which resulted in the AMR23 being 2.4 seconds quicker than its predecessor in the first qualifying session of the season. However, other teams eventually caught up and overtook Aston Martin in the championship as it brought limited upgrades to the car, scoring just two podiums in the final 14 grands prix.

Nevertheless, it was a remarkable turnaround from 2022 when Aston Martin started that year without a point in the opening three races and its best result was sixth in Azerbaijan, Singapore and Japan.

Alpine had an underwhelming 2023, dropping two positions in the championship and scoring 53 fewer points. A large reason for this was the inconsistent A523 car which usually suffered at high-speed and low-downforce circuits, while reliability was often a problem with  retiring from six grands prix. The management turmoil did not help matters either, as Laurent Rossi, Otmar Szafnauer and Alan Permane all left midway through the season.

But there were some positive moments for the French outfit, who scored two podiums with its new driver line-up. Ocon claimed third in Monaco, while  achieved the same result in Zandvoort en route to the drivers finishing 11th and 12th in the standings.

So, it was a very up-and-down season for Alpine who finished a very comfortable sixth and showed much less consistency than 2022 where the team scored points in all but three grands prix.

Williams was one of the most improved teams in 2023 as the British outfit achieved its highest finishing position since 2017, after coming last in four of the following five seasons. Key to Williams’ improvement was its frightening straight-line speed where  topped the speed trap in Canada at 213.1mph.

The 27-year-old had a terrific season, finishing 13th in the championship – six places higher than 2022 – with 27 points, yet team-mate  struggled. The rookie scored just one point, which came because Leclerc and Hamilton were both disqualified from the United States GP, but Sargeant has still been retained for 2024.

A new team principal in James Vowles was also behind Williams’ improved form, and the team now look in good stead to build on their seventh-place finish rather than dropping back down to last.

AlphaTauri improved significantly towards the end of 2023 thanks to a largely updated package. The Italian outfit scored 22 of their 25 points after the summer break, which caused AlphaTauri to rise from bottom to eighth in the constructors’ championship and bring it closer to its 2022 total.

A factor behind this was the improved performances of , who beat his 2022 points tally (12) by five, climbed three positions in the standings to come 14th and showed much greater consistency in his fight for a top-10 finish.

The 23-year-old adopted more of a team leader role following the departure of Gasly, while the seat alongside him was never quite settled with Tsunoda having three separate team-mates across 2023.

Alfa Romeo started the ground effect era with much promise as it scored a double points finish in the 2022 season-opening Bahrain GP. That contributed to a points tally of 51 in the opening nine grands prix before scoring just four in the following 13, as Alfa was slow on upgrades in the latter half of 2022.

Unfortunately for the team it has struggled to rediscover its form from the start of that season as the Swiss outfit scored just 16 points across 2023. It happened because the team failed to meet targets they set for the season, meaning Alfa was largely playing catch-up when it came to upgrades.

It resulted in  finishing 15th in the drivers’ championship, five places lower than 2022, while Zhou Guanyu came 18th in both seasons.

Much like Alfa Romeo, Haas began the ground effect era with plenty to be positive about. The American squad started 2022 with points in three of the opening four races after starting development on its VF-22 much earlier than others.

Haas finished the year eighth in the championship, which included a shock pole position for  in rain-hit Brazil, but things were much different in 2023. Its car really struggled with the overheating of tyres meaning Haas had a big disadvantage in races.

Despite solid efforts from its drivers  - who returned to F1 for 2023 - and Magnussen, Haas claimed just four points finishes in the season which left them bottom of the standings.

DATE: 2023

On Tuesday the FIA announced its Compliance Department was looking into allegations made in a dubious publication suggesting Mercedes team boss Wolff and his wife Susie, who heads FOM's F1 Academy, were exchanging confidential information.

The probe took all parties involved by surprise and invoked a furious response by the Wolffs, Mercedes and F1's management. F1 and Mercedes rejected the allegations and condemned the lack of communication from the governing body over its pending investigation.

Amid speculation that rival teams had complained to the FIA about the Wolffs, all nine remaining F1 teams disputed they were behind the probe with statements backing the pair on Wednesday.

On Thursday the FIA then backtracked and announced that there would be no formal investigation after being satisfied that there was no "unauthorised disclosure of confidential information".

In a statement released by Mercedes on Friday, Toto Wolff said his team was in an "active legal exchange" with the governing body after seeing his and his wife's reputation damaged by this week's events.

Given the possible legal consequences of the row, Wolff said there would be no further official comment for the time being.

"We understand that there is significant media interest in the events of this week," Wolff's statement read.

Toto Wolff, Team Principal and CEO, Mercedes-AMG

"We are currently in active legal exchange with the FIA.

"We await full transparency about what took place and why, and have expressly reserved all legal rights.

"Therefore we ask for your understanding that we will not be commenting officially for now, but we will certainly address the matter in due course."

Susie Wolff also made further comments on the matter on Friday, slamming the FIA for its lack of transparency.

"For two days, insinuations have been made about my integrity in public and through background briefings, but nobody from the FIA has spoken to me directly," she said.

"I might have been collateral damage in an unsuccessful attack on somebody else, or the target of a failed attempt to discredit me personally, but I have worked too hard to have my reputation called into question by an unfounded press release.

She added: "This episode has so far taken place without transparency or accountability."

DATE: 2023

But the shockwaves from the FIA's decision to declare that it was looking into a potential conflict of interest over the passing of confidential information between the Wolffs are going to stick around for a while.

There remains a bitter aftertaste to all that has happened because no parties have come out of the events of the week looking good.

The Wolffs, Mercedes and FOM have had their reputations sullied by the allegations, the media has been caught up in a misinformation fog of war, and the FIA's actions have led to it being on the receiving end of heavy criticism.

The events of the week were entirely avoidable, as the whole thing could have been conducted in private and settled without the need for anyone in the outside world to even know about it.

But it's the fact that matters went so public, and the disparity between the FIA's view of there being team complaints and all of Mercedes' rivals insisting that is not the case, that has left some lingering questions about the whole affair.

Here we dig down into the key issues that still stand out.

What prompted the probe in the first place?

One of the most confusing aspects of the whole case remains the suggestions of team complaints about the confidential information being passed on to Toto Wolff.

While FIA sources were adamant that some F1 team principals were in contact over the situation – and this information appeared to have been briefed to many media outlets – the nine team statements from Mercedes' rivals suggest that was not the case.

This is the biggest disconnect of the whole saga.

There is obviously a world of difference between a team lodging an official formal complaint over the behaviour of a rival, and a boss having a quiet moan during paddock chatter. But the latter is not normally grounds to go big on investigations.

So what conversations really took place and with whom?

And if there were no formal complaints about the situation, was a single news story in a magazine – even if it prompted a few media inquiries – enough to justify going so big on the probe?

Ultimately, it is the FIA's duty to ensure that regulations are upheld – it even talked about integrity and fairness in its statement announcing the inquiry was over.

But equally, there is a world of difference between going through due process to look at something in private to confirm everything is above board, and then going public and making a huge deal out of it.

Why was the FIA so eager to go public?

Perhaps the most baffling aspect of the whole sorry affair is why the FIA felt the need to go so public that its compliance department was looking into the situation.

Such a statement would normally only come if there was strong evidence to suggest that a rules breach had taken place and there was a case to be answered.

Normally such situations are expected to be dealt with behind closed doors – even in private phone calls between the FIA and individuals involved – before there is any hint of it reaching the public domain.

So, the FIA's decision to issue its statement, before even Mercedes, the Wolffs and FOM knew anything about it, remains quite difficult to understand.

That is even more true considering that there seemed to be almost nothing to base the case on.

The FIA's announcement on Thursday that it was calling off its inquiry said the decision was made after a simple review of documents, so there was never actually a proper investigation of events in the first place

It said: "Formula One Management's F1 Code of Conduct and F1 Conflict of Interest Policy and confirmation that appropriate protective measures are in place to mitigate any potential conflicts.

"The FIA is satisfied that FOM's compliance management system is robust enough to prevent any unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.

This is something that could and should have been done well before the need to go public.

In its statement on Thursday night, the FIA said it reaffirmed its commitment to 'integrity and fairness'.

But it cannot be lost on the governing body that going public with the compliance department's involvement was not especially 'fair' to the Wolffs, Mercedes or FOM in throwing suspicions out there that ultimately proved to be false.

Is there a private agenda at play?

Mohammed bin Sulayem, President, FIA

The FIA's decision to go public with the compliance department's involvement has been viewed by some as part of an agenda that its president Mohammed Ben Sulayem has against Wolff.

It has been linked to Lewis Hamilton being investigated for crossing the track in Qatar, and to Wolff being summoned for swearing in a press conference in Las Vegas.

But while there may be suspicions of this being part of a Machiavellian plot, the reality may be that the latest affair follows more the pattern of Ben Sulayem simply being aggressive and committed to following what he thinks is the right thing to do: even if it is at odds with what others perceive is right.

All his controversial moments – think of the comments about a potential Saudi buyout of F1, the jewelry ban, talk about bringing Michael Masi back to F1 – all come from him pursuing what he thinks right at that moment in time, without considering longer-term consequences and implications.

This is a very different approach from previous FIA presidents who have focused more on the bigger picture and longer-term implications.

Ben Sulayem may have viewed publicly declaring the Wolff case as simple evidence of the FIA's transparency, and that it was willing to go the extra mile to investigate any suspicion of rule breaches – rather than holding back and realizing the potential damage it could cause.

Few (even likely within the FIA) now doubt that the better thing to have done would have been to address it all in private rather than stir up the storm it did.

While the FIA may hope that calling off its probe will be an end to the matter, that will almost certainly not be the case.

From Wolff and Mercedes' perspective, after a week where reputations have taken a battering, this is not something that can be quickly forgotten.

It is understood that discussions are ongoing between the FIA and Mercedes about the fallout, and that will likely include how to redress any potential reputational damage that may have occurred.

It will be interesting to see if there is any public apology or declaration of remorse for the FIA or Ben Sulayem over how things were handled this week.

Going forward, it is clear that the FIA has to learn some critical lessons in how it deals with such matters in the future.

Getting the compliance department to check that everyone is following the letter of the law is one thing, but dragging such matters into the public domain is another.

Knowing full well that this whole Wolff saga could have been dealt with in a few phone calls and emails – rather than being fed to and exploding in the media – should hopefully act as a guide for where improvements must be made in the future.

DATE: 2023

On Tuesday evening, the governing body announced that its Compliance Department was looking into an allegation of confidential information between an F1 team principal and a member of Formula One Management.

This was in relation to a dubious media report that in a meeting between team principals, Toto Wolff supposedly made a comment based on material information that was only available to FOM personnel, to which his spouse Susie Wolff could theoretically have greater access given her role at the top of the all-female race series.

The allegation was denounced by Mercedes, Susie Wolff - who suggested alternative motives were at play, saying the matter was rooted "in intimidatory and misogynistic behaviour" - and F1, whose relationship with the FIA, particularly under the current administration, is strained.

Then, in a coordinated and almost unprecedented display of paddock unity, particularly around Susie Wolff, the other nine teams released near-identical statements that read: "We can confirm that we have not made any complaint to the FIA regarding the allegation of information of a confidential nature being passed between an F1 team principal and a member of FOM staff.

"We are pleased and proud to support F1 Academy and its managing director through our commitment to sponsor an entrant in our liveries from next season."

With all teams denying they had lodged a complaint, it piled extreme pressure on the FIA to disclose precisely why it had decided to investigate the Wolffs.

But on Thursday evening, a day ahead of the FIA Awards Gala, the governing body revealed that it was satisfied no conflict of interest could have taken place so the matter was dropped.

A statement read: "Following a review of Formula One Management's F1 Code of Conduct and F1 Conflict of Interest Policy and confirmation that appropriate protective measures are in place to mitigate any potential conflicts, the FIA is satisfied that FOM's compliance management system is robust enough to prevent any unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.

"The FIA can confirm that there is no ongoing investigation in terms of ethical or disciplinary inquiries involving any individual.

"As the regulator, the FIA has a duty to maintain the integrity of global motorsport. The FIA reaffirms its commitment to integrity and fairness."

And with that, it is time to head off for a break. We'll be back at 5:45am GMT ahead of FP2 but for now, here is the full session report from the first outing of the weekend. As ever, thanks for your company!

Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes F1 W15

Photo by: Sam Bloxham / Motorsport Images

It should be noted, even Hamilton's session best time was roughly three seconds off the pole lap of 12 months ago, highlighting the evolution that is yet to come in the following sessions.

By the time FP1 came to a close, both the air and track temperatures had dropped by three degrees. This fall is expected to continue into FP2, which takes place at a similar time to both qualifying and the race.

"That was the first session we've had since Toto Wolff's comments on Hamilton's "shelf-life" emerged - the Mercedes boss has since moved to explain what he meant - but for the seven-time world champion that was a response that will have had him smiling under his helmet, while his face flashed up the Vegas night as it shone from the Sphere"

"I know it was only first practice, but that was another unimpressive run for Sergio Perez. His best time is only good enough for 10th place on the time sheets. Time is running out for him to prove he deserves to retain his seat at Red Bull next year. The other aspect is that Red Bull need him to start delivering points if they are to claw back their way into contention to win the constructors' championship."

Completing practice starts on the grid, Verstappen has massively overshot the grid box. Were that to happen in the race, he would be in hot water for that one.

Hamilton's final lap was 0.396s up on Russell. He has 0.953s over Norris in third and all other drivers are over a second back.

And Hamilton moves to the top with a 1m35.001s. With no one else on a hot lap, he will exit the car as the fastest man in the session.

Hamilton is into the final sector of his final effort, as he goes purple in sector one.

The chequered flag flies and Sainz is the first driver to take it.

"So far, so good for the new FIA race director, Rui Marques. Not major incidents like we saw last year so he has been able to easy himself into the big seat left vacant by Niels Wittich, who left the role after the Sao Paulo Grand Prix. We have Toto Wolff in the press conference later, so it will be good to get his thoughts on the shock departure and what he makes of Marques."

Hamilton goes top, but Russell is faster still with a third consecutive flying lap, moving to a 1m35.397s.

And we're about to see what Hamilton can do with soft, as he begins his first timed effort on the compound.

As the click ticks below five minutes, Russell returns Mercedes to the top with a 1m35.619s.

"It is another cold one in Vegas tonight, as soon as the sun disappears the temperature really does drop. While the FP1 action might not set pulses racing, race organisers will be happy to come through unscathed after last year. The fans who have come out for the first running are also making the most of it...maybe just to warm up!"

We're seeing a decent number of drivers in the pits now, we're probably going to see some warm tyres bolted on for a round of closing flying laps to end the session.

Hamilton is the only driver not to have tried soft tyres yet in this session.

10 minutes remain in FP1.

Up from 14th to sixth for Verstappen, but he remains 0.807s off the pace of Norris.

Verstappen reports a "connection issue" with his steering wheel, complaining that the radio "went on by itself". A peculiar problem, for sure.

McLaren has shown its hand for the first time this weekend, with Norris the first driver below 96s, putting in a 1m35.954s, as team-mate Piastri improves to fourth, sandwiching the Ferrari drivers.

Hamilton and Russell are out again but on medium tyres.

But he's immediately forced back by Ferrari team-mate Sainz who hammers in a 1m36.218s.

The first change at the top for a while, as Leclerc now puts in a 1m36.430s to better Hamilton by 0.497s.

And we've had confirmation of a five-place grid penalty for Bottas, after the Sauber driver has had a fourth energy store fitted to his car.

Yellow flags were briefly displayed again there - no explanation why quite yet.

On softs, Leclerc puts in a purple middle and personal bests in the other two sectors to move up to second, behind only Hamilton.

Magnussen is on it once again, moving up to third for Haas. This is the freedom of a driver knowing they aren't driving for their future.

"We have a voice but we don't have a vote," McLaren Racing CEO tells Sky Sports on the changing of the F1 race director. He hopes the move is a "step forward".

On the plus side, no drain issues to this point!

From 10th to third for Norris. The times have largely stabilised for the moment, but with another round of fresh rubber, the picture could all change very quickly.

Highlighting the pit entry issue, Albon has now been shown the same black and white flag as his Williams team-mate for crossing the white line.

"The pit entry line is almost impossible to see," reports Russell. With all the lines of the road, it is hugely difficult to pick out.

As per Chandhok's suggestion, a thick yellow line would clear up any confusion there.

An odd problem for Piastri here, as his McLaren refuses to switch off as his mechanics push the car back into the garage. It's eventually fixed, but as per the roll hoop lights, it was an electrical issue.

Currently, Mercedes enjoy a 1-2 led by Hamilton, with Leclerc leading a Ferrari 3-4. Championship players Norris and Verstappen are 10th and 9th respectively.

While the track is never going to fall completely silent during a session this weekend, half the grid have returned to the pits, resulting in a quieter track.

The first black and white flag of the weekend goes to Colapinto. Currently in 18th, he failed to follow the race director's event notes and crossed the white line on pit entry.

Proving how difficult the conditions are, Verstappen runs deep at the end of The Strip following a heavy lock up - his Red Bull screaming as it slid past the cameras.

C3? We can see a few more than that! Mercedes opted for 25 sets of the medium tyre compound for the Bahrain test, more than any other team, having decided to take only two sets each of the C1 and C2. As the Bahrain track surface is so rough, the C3 will serve as next weekend's softest compound - so the team has already got an eye on the season opener.

DATE: 2024

trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin believes the team's fluctuating form over the 2024 Formula 1 season was a result of it being pegged back in development in trying to recover from a tough start.

The Brackley-based squad opted for an entirely new approach with its W15 concept, opting for a more conventional sidepod solution and pushrod-activated rear suspension assembly.

It took time for the team to fully suss out the merits of its new car before it could flesh the concepts on it out further, which Shovlin reckoned set it back against the other teams in the season's development cycle.

He says Mercedes' upgrades were usually out of sync with those of its top-four rivals, allowing it to remain more competitive for a couple of rounds before cycling behind in the pecking order once the other teams had introduced new parts.

"I think the big one is development. And if you look at when we brought our updates compared to our main competitors, we were often bringing our big package a couple of races later," Shovlin explained.

"But if we brought it earlier, it would be a smaller package. So the fact is, on average, over a season, we've not been quick enough when we deliver an update, we had a few races where we were competitive, the teams were trying to beat them, bring theirs, and they moved back ahead.

"That's definitely the main mechanism. I think the start of the season was poor. The car wasn't well balanced, wasn't working across a range of tracks.

"We got on top of those issues over the first seven or so races. And then I think we've just been in a normal development race over the remainder of the year."

Shovlin added that one of the team's goals for its 2025 car is to reduce the amount of tyre overheating at the rear axle, as he felt that this was an area where Mercedes paled versus its front-running rivals.

Although the W15 was able to get its tyres up to temperature more easily than others in colder conditions, this led to earlier thermal degradation at warmer circuits.

He also noted that Mercedes' struggles to get on top of optimising its car around a given ride height was also part of its considerations, as the W15 tended to struggle on bumpier circuits.

"Rear overheating, that's an area where I don't think we are as good as , Red Bull or , and that's probably affected as most recently at tracks like Singapore," Shovlin added.

"So we're looking at what we can do to get temperature out of the rear tyres - and any work in that area is twofold: one is can we put less temperature in? And the other one is, can we take more temperature out?

"But that's clearly an area where, on a Sunday, we had a big gap to the front in some of those races. And definitely an area of focus for next year.

"It's very fair to say on those [bumpier] tracks, we do suffer more often. You can do analysis on how high people are running, and I don't think we're wildly different to anyone else, but ride is an area that we've been focusing on with these regulations.

"In general, we've made progress. But the whole thing of development in Formula 1 is fixing problems, and can you fix them quicker than your competitors. And that's how you get to the front."

DATE: 2024

reckons his lost 2024 Formula 1 Belgian Grand Prix victory was a better drive than his Las Vegas domination because of how in the former he held off ’s charge.

Russell’s mid-race switch to a one-stop strategy meant he cycled to the lead at Spa when his  team-mate Hamilton had led convincingly on the conventional two-stopper.

The younger Briton then held on through the tense finale as the seven-time world champion and ’s  arrived at his rear end for the closing laps.

Then, with the Mercedes W15 performing well against the year’s best cars in what was another weekend of cool temperatures in Vegas, Russell won commandingly from pole.

But, when Motorsport.com asked him which performance he was most proud of at the 2024 Abu Dhabi season finale, Russell picked Spa.

This was even though he lost that result for his car/driver post-race weight total coming in 1.5kg under the minimum allowed in F1’s rules – a situation to which Russell held some blame as he had known his weight was down on what it should have been when he climbed aboard his W15.

“Spa was definitely the best drive without doubt,” Russell explained.

“Because Vegas – probably those first 12 laps were probably the best 12 laps I've ever done in an F1 race and from there on in, it was effectively just bring the car home and don't grain the tyres and we'll win this race.

“But Belgium was a proper fight. It was a roll of the dice [on strategy].

“I knew I couldn't make a single mistake, especially when it came to those last two and three laps.

“Lewis was in DRS, I had to nail the first corner because the run was so long to Turn 5 and knowing you can't be too conservative because he's on fresh tyres and he will just breeze past, I can't lock up and make a mistake because he'll breeze past, and just knowing exactly how hard you can push.

“That was a drive I'll forever be proud of.”

puts his comprehensive Formula 1 2024 defeat of former  team-mate  in qualifying down to being “psychologically in a really good place”.

The 26-year-old ended the 2024 season with a 24-6 qualifying record against Hamilton, with all sessions including those that set the grid for sprint events taken into consideration.

This compares with their 8-12 and 15-13 records from 2022 (when there were just three sprints overall and only one qualifying session on each such weekend, hence the lower total) and 2023.

Hamilton often struggled to maintain promising practice form during his final Mercedes campaign with the troublesome W15, where Russell also led him in the points standings and each finished the season with two wins apiece.

This would have been a 3-1 split in Russell’s favour but for his .

When asked by Motorsport.com why he feels he was so good at qualifying compared to Hamilton at the recent 2024 season finale in Abu Dhabi, Russell replied: “I just feel really confident within the car, confident within myself.

“I feel psychologically I'm in a really good place, especially when it comes to these high-pressure scenarios to get the most out of myself.

“I'm not gonna compare against my team-mate, but just in terms of my own personal performance, I feel [I’m] driving better than ever.”

Russell also said he felt even better in himself compared to the start of 2024, when it became clear he would be set to lead Mercedes as Hamilton decided to join  for .

“Every driver is capable of doing great laps and great performances, but when the pressure's up and it comes down to that one lap in Q3 – that's where it comes down to your headspace, really,” Russell said of how his psychological feeling had impacted his 2024 results.

“And I feel like I've learned a lot about myself and how to get the most out of myself. And for everyone it's different. But I just know in myself what works for me.”

What did we learn from that session ahead of qualifying? Well, Mercedes still appears strong and the track conditions will ramp up with every lap, so it could be a case of the last to set a lap time may triumph.

So, a flurry of very late action to round out FP3 topped by Russell from Piastri, Sainz, Norris, Verstappen and Hamilton.

Anyway, the other 18 drivers minus Perez and Stroll do get to enjoy an out-lap, lap to the grid for a practice start and then an in-lap. Not much to learn, but it still sees the RBs almost collide as Tsunoda gets his braking wrong and nearly goes into the rear of Lawson.

Perez misses the opportunity to get out on track at the back of the car train, so he has to park at the end of the pitlane facing the red light. He's the only one to miss out and it was an odd one given he left a big gap to Russell ahead. He could've made it.

Stroll has come to a stop just outside the Venetian, as the car's red lights turn off so the marshals can recover the Aston Martin. The session will resume - for exactly 60 seconds to be precise.

Stroll's car totally switched off before he came to a halt and the red lights are flashing on his Aston Martin to indicate it isn't safe to touch yet. That could mean the session is effectively over with three minutes to go.

Not for long though, as a red flag is shown with Stroll parked at the side of the track with his Aston Martin smoking.

But just like that Verstappen is suddenly shuffled down to fifth as Russell goes fastest from Piastri, Sainz and Norris. The lap times keep on coming.

"The grip felt miles better," Verstappen reports on team radio. It certainly seems Red Bull has dialled in that car over the last hour.

Verstappen goes fastest of anyone with a 1m34.137s - 0.081s up on Russell. Problems, what problems?

Perez only manages 11th and 1.4s off the outright pace. Where does Verstappen stack up?

Verstappen has bailed out of his first push lap on the softs as Perez carries on. At the front, Russell takes over top spot again with a 1m34.218s.

Aaaaand there they are. Right on cue, Verstappen and Perez come out in formation and both on fresh soft tyres. Let's see what they've got ahead of qualifying.

There are 15 minutes left in FP3 but still no sign of the Red Bull drivers who haven't ventured out on the soft tyres yet.

After seeing so many empty seats for practice two, it is encouraging to see more spectators here for FP3. After asking around, it seems the locals are not bothered about practice, unlike some of the more-established markets. Organisers say they expect a full house on Saturday, so that's where their focus is. It does make it valid to suggest that perhaps, in order to increase ticket sales, Vegas should be selected as a location for the sprint races. At least it would get the punters in.

Russell briefly takes top spot only for his team-mate Hamilton to reply with a 1m34.341s - once again it is looking promising for Mercedes in these cold and slippery conditions. Can it last until the sessions that really matter?

A switch to Hamilton's onboard camera shows he is pushing on the softs, as he goes fastest overall with a 1m34.565s.

Plenty of lap time improvements elsewhere, as Magnussen goes fastest with a 1m34.883s for Haas.

"This is... I can't drive it. I'm gonna crash. My left front is completely f******," Verstappen says, stating his case to pit. Red Bull duly obliges and calls in its driver.

"It's only getting worse. The car is undriveable," Verstappen reports on team radio. "Just a couple more laps please Max. Have to try and make the best of this," Lambiase replies to his driver. That came after a lock-up at Turn 5.

All 20 drivers are on track so suddenly there is a fair bit of traffic to navigate. Hamilton gets caught behind Alonso and then Tsunoda to restrict his opening time lap to 1m36.590s.

Norris and then Piastri take over at the top, the Australian posting a 1m35.759s for top spot in the McLaren 1-2.

Tsunoda blows that theory away with a 1m37.517s to go three seconds quicker than Verstappen. A high number of drivers are on out-laps now so this track will ramp up rapidly over the final 34 minutes.

Norris posts a 1m41.653s to slot into third behind both Red Bulls. Another warm-up lap or is the track really this much slower? Verstappen improves to go top but only with a 1m40.588s.

Norris has come out to be our yardstick, running on the soft tyres, as Perez and Verstappen both improve by a handful of tenths on their next laps.

Verstappen's opening effort is a leisurely 1m42.180s on the medium tyres. It seems hard to believe track conditions mean nine seconds slower than FP2, but let's see what others can produce before drawing conclusions.

Verstappen has had enough of the hanging around in the pits and nips out for the first time in the session, joined by team-mate Perez. Given all the trouble-free running yesterday - just the one short red flag caused by Albon stoppage in FP2 - it perhaps isn't surprising there isn't much track action early in FP3.

The hard tyre scrubbing continues for a handful of drivers, meaning it is just Tsunoda on track at present. And still just the one lap time overall which came from Perez earlier.

It may only be a practice session but Red Bull and Max Verstappen, in particular, will be keen to show improvement on their performance yesterday. We know the wing is an issue but with everything else now turned up to qualifying spec, let’s see where they actually sit in terms of pace.

Lawson, who has also joined the fun scrubbing in his hard tyres, says it is very slippery on track. The circuit reopened for public traffic between FP2 and this session, so it will be a case of rebuilding the grip levels and cleaning the racing line.

"Ah. Miles off," Perez says over team radio after his first timed lap of 1m41.941s. Given FP2's top times were in the 1m33s, he's made an accurate summation.

Both Aston Martins are also in action early while the rest stay comfortable and warm in the garages. Handy, as it is 14.9C air temperature and given the timing of the sessions that is the warmest it'll be all night.

Zhou nips out for an early exploration of the Las Vegas Strip, taking in the sights during his installation lap. He's joined by Perez and Hamilton, with the Red Bull driver sporting a visibly trimmed rear wing - it looks like someone's taken a bite out of it.

Off we go for final practice!

said hearing race engineer Pete Bonnington gee him up with their famous "hammertime" catchphrase one last time was a poignant moment as he departs  for .

Hamilton and his long-time engineer Bonnington, or Bono for short, forged a formidable partnership at Mercedes that led to six drivers' titles and helped the Brackley-based squad win eight constructors' crowns on the trot between 2014 and 2021.

Their trademark "hammertime" phrase, used by Bono when Hamilton needed to pump out a string of qualifying laps during a race, soon made it into the public domain but saw less use this season as Hamilton and Mercedes went through a campaign with some ups but also plenty of downs.

Their partnership has now come to a conclusion, with Hamilton leaving for Ferrari and Bonnington staying at Mercedes. But as the seven-time world champion ended his Mercedes career with a gritty comeback drive from 16th to fourth in Abu Dhabi, Hamilton said getting fired up by his trusted race engineer one last time was a particularly poignant moment.

When asked by Motorsport.com if hearing "hammertime" one last time geed him up even more than it usually did, he smiled: “I noticed that today. When he told me, I was like ‘I can’t even remember the last time he told me hammertime’.

“I remember I told Bono to say hammertime back in the first year together. I was like, ‘Don’t just tell me to go faster, tell me it’s hammertime and I know what it is’."

Hamilton paid tribute to his long-time ally, who he said has become one of his best friends over the years.

"What a rollercoaster ride I’ve had with Bono," Hamilton added. "He’s been one of my closest friends for many years.

"It’s something I didn’t expect to have because he worked with , he’s worked with great drivers and for the longest time he’s stood by me.

"For an engineer to stick by someone, as frustrating and painful as it can sometimes be – he’s stood by me every single day without fail.”

DATE: 2024

boss Toto Wolff says joy at ’s charge to fourth in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was tempered by annoyance that he should have been in the victory fight.

Hamilton was taking part in his final race weekend for the Mercedes team after a 12-year stint that had netted six drivers’ titles and 84 victories.

But hopes of a successful send-off, after some promising pace in practice, was derailed in qualifying when Hamilton hit a bollard that had been thrown into the track by  in the closing stages of Q1.

The loose cone got stuck under his car and, badly affecting his aerodynamics, meant his lap was ruined and he failed to make it through to Q2.

After starting 16th, Hamilton showed brilliant speed and tyre management on an alternative strategy in the race to grab fourth place on the final lap after a spectacular overtaking move on team-mate .

While that result provided an uplifting send-off for Hamilton and Mercedes after some struggles in recent events, Wolff said that he could not get it out of his head that without the bad luck with the bollard, the seven-time champion should have been right at the front.

"I always try to be analytical and, if the bollard hadn't been in our way yesterday, I think Lewis could have fought for the victory,” said Wolff.

“On the other side, something he said to me is that we have had so many race victories, so much success, that these last races, they don't change anything of how we feel.

“He drove like a world champion today. From P16, working his way slowly through the cars, playing the long game and then finishing in fourth, driving away from the Red Bull. That was a statement of a world champion."

Mercedes’ pre-race estimations had pointed to Hamilton finishing sixth, but he was helped on his way by an opening corner collision between front row starter  and .

Wolff added: "Before the race, the best estimate was P6. On pure pace and medium tyre to medium tyre with Lando, he was two-tenths slower. But obviously with Lewis' traffic situation etcetera, we would have been right up there."

While Hamilton has taken part in his final race for Mercedes, he will now take part in a number of sponsorship and promotional appearances as part of a winter farewell tour before he is released to .

But Wolff said that after such a long time together, the bonds between them will ultimately never be broken.

"It has been 12 years,” he said. “It is not only the longest driver-team relationship the sport has ever seen; it is probably also one of the longest relationships that any sports team had with a player.

“It has been one of the longest relationships we have had personally with another person and that creates attachment, and trust. And those values, in this day and age, are rare.

“That's why it is a period of time that we will always hold close to our hearts and one of the best periods that I have personally had with the team."

Wolff said that he and Hamilton would make every effort to try to maintain their relationship in the future even though they will become rivals from 2025.

"We said we are going to work hard on maintaining the relationship,” he said. “It is going to be fierce competition on the track but if individuals want a relationship to continue beyond competition, we will do so.

“We will still be doing our sports sessions where we are both competitive, and try to beat each other; or ride a motorbike, have dinner together and all of those things."

DATE: 2025

team principal Toto Wolff says Formula 1’s cost cap made the world championship a “meritocracy” rather than an “arms race”, after  won its first drivers’ title since 2008.

prevailed over  and McLaren team-mate  to end a 15-season streak of Red Bull and Mercedes triumphs in the world championship.

Red Bull, Mercedes and  used to be the wealthiest F1 outfits by a significant margin, but the cost cap introduced in 2021 made the championship a more level-playing field.

Mercedes struggled throughout the ground-effect era that began in 2022 and recently ended in Abu Dhabi, winning just seven of 92 grands prix over that period.

Asked whether the Silver Arrows could have recovered more ground without the cost cap, Wolff replied: “You know, we were pretty conscious when the budget cap came – not only for the commercial side of things, but also to have a more level-playing field among the teams, and not just the usual suspects that were outspending each other.

“So, would we have been able to buy ourselves out? Look at Red Bull or Ferrari, they have the same financial opportunities or possibilities that we have. So, it would have again ended up in an arms race. And maybe it wouldn't have been McLaren fighting there with us on top.

“This is just a meritocracy. Best man in best machine wins. And it wasn't us.”

McLaren’s Norris has a similar outlook on the situation, claiming the Woking-based squad outdeveloped its rivals “by a long way” – though Red Bull eventually made up most of its deficit.

“Another constructors’ [title] feels the same as the first because to get the first was quite an achievement if you still look at where we were just three years ago,” the Briton said in October. “We’ve overtaken every team in terms of development. We’ve outdone them by a long way in terms of development.

“And in a time when it’s almost harder to do than ever – with more restrictions, less wind tunnel time, all of those different things, budget cap – that’s probably been more in our favour over the last five years compared to the budget that the other teams could run at.”

DATE: 2025

Former Top Gear and The Grand Tour executive producer Andy Wilman has revealed that  personally overruled  boss Ron Dennis to appear in the BBC show's "Star in a Reasonably Priced Car" segment in the famous and humble Suzuki Liana instead of a  supercar.

Speaking on the Midweek F1 podcast, Wilman explained that the seven-time champion's first visit to the Dunsfold test track came straight off the back of his rookie Formula 1 season, in which he missed the championship win by just a single point.

“Well, the first time he came down, I think it was when he just lost that rookie season, the championship by [one point],” Wilman said. “So McLaren is still Ron Dennis days, so we're getting all Ron Dennis-ish-ness coming down the phone, like 'he's in a Suzuki Liana,' you know?

"And then like I think it was Matt Bishop was a PR at the time. Matt Bishop sort of rings and he goes, ‘Oh, Ron wants him to do it in like an SLR.’”

Wilman admitted that the Top Gear team pushed back hard, insisting that the whole point of the segment was to level the playing field with the modest Suzuki.

“And we're like, ‘It's not the point, like... same car,'” he continued. “And he went, ‘Yeah, you know what Ron's like.’ And Ron's gone, ‘Yeah, but he's a Mercedes man.’ And we're like, ‘Jesus Christ, Ron, is anybody going to go, well, I'm going to buy a Liana now. I won't buy that S-Class.’ It's like, let it go.”

Hamilton's love for the British car show was a strong motivator for the young driver, who was keen to join presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May in their famous studio.

“And then I think Lewis stepped in even as a kid and went, ‘I'm doing Top Gear,’ because he was such a kid and he'd grown up watching it, you know?” Wilman said. “So, it was a red-letter day for him. Now, obviously now he's stratospheric and everything bows to him, but back then he was like, ‘I'm coming down.’”

The now-Ferrari driver would go on to set a very competitive lap time in the Suzuki, matching Jenson Button's lap time despite driving in wet conditions.

"He was amazing. I remember watching that second-to-last corner," the producer continued. "He was incredible, which was that sort of... I don't know who came up with it, but it's like you're going from a motorway to a country lane almost at a right angle.

"And he seemed to get it better than anyone else. But it was a wet time so he wasn't top of the board."

Hamilton eventually set the fastest time on the board on his second attempt with a time of 1m42.9s, only to be beaten by former F1 driver  by seven tenths soon after.

DATE: 2025

Two days after the conclusion of the 2025 season, F1 teams switched all focus to 2026’s new era. At Yas Marina Circuit, the traditional post-season test had a dual purpose this time.

Each team took to the track with one mule car to test Pirelli’s new 2026 tyres. The mule cars are still ground-effect machinery, but have been modified to mimic next year’s downforce levels – mainly by changing the wing levels (Monza style) and ride height. The other 10 cars were allocated to rookies in the young drivers’ test.

and  were “fortunately” allowed to skip the post-season test, to use the Dutchman’s own words. Instead, Red Bull put  in the mule car to give him an early feel for the 2026 rubber, with Ayumu Iwasa serving as its rookie. Next year’s F1 debutant Arvid Lindblad got his chance with sister squad .

At  and , all regular drivers were present, each completing half a day of running.  handled the full Tuesday for  – the team that attracted the most attention in the pitlane once the light went green.

Mercedes tested active aerodynamics on its front wing for the first time, offering a preview of what’s to come in 2026. The Silver Arrow featured a prototype that had been approved by the FIA, allowing Antonelli’s front wing to switch into a low-downforce and low-drag mode along the straights, exactly as will happen next year.

The differences between the mule cars and the rookie cars – which, in addition to running more downforce, were still on 2025 tyres – meant that the young drivers locked out the fastest times. Luke Browning set the pace in the morning with a 1m23.920s in his . That target time stood until the sun had almost set in Abu Dhabi and temperatures dropped.

Aston Martin junior Jak Crawford took full advantage of the cooler conditions, clocking a 1m23.766s to go to the top. The American beat ’s Paul Aron, who stepped into the  for this occasion, and Browning. Mercedes reserve driver Frederik Vesti and Iwasa rounded out the top five.

Antonelli followed in sixth place as the fastest mule-car driver. With a best lap of 1m25.170s, he was almost one-and-a-half seconds slower than Crawford. The Italian was also nearly a second quicker than the next mule-car driver:  in P10.

Because Antonelli ran with active aerodynamics, he did not have to adhere to the 300km/h straightline speed limit imposed by Pirelli as the loads on the tyres will be different on the straights next year. Antonelli was also the most productive driver of the day, completing 157 laps.

The test ran without significant issues apart from a crash by Ryo Hirakawa. His incident at Turn 1 caused a red flag and damage to the rear wing, although the Japanese driver was able to return to the track soon after.  completed only four laps in the afternoon due to apparent technical issues at Haas.

DATE: 2025

During the post-season test at the Yas Marina Circuit, Formula 1 teams are given nine hours to gather data about Pirelli’s 2026 tyres.

The test is carried out using mule cars – ground-effect machinery modified to mimic 2026’s lower downforce levels. All teams run with reduced wing levels (comparable to Monza) and altered ride heights to shed downforce.

An interesting aspect is that the FIA has permitted teams to run certain prototypes in Tuesday’s test. One area where this applies is the front wing.

DRS will disappear from F1 in 2026 and be replaced by active aerodynamics, meaning drivers will open both the front and rear wings on every straight. As a result, the front wing will become an active component too, unlike in previous seasons.

A first glimpse of the future can be seen in Abu Dhabi on the Mercedes mule car driven by Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The car is equipped with a Straight Line Mode system, allowing the front wing to generate less drag on the straights.

Mercedes’ system at this test is far from refined, with an actuation system on the upper wing elements connected to the nose cone with via large tubing. This allows the wing to switch to a low-downforce configuration on the straights, mirroring what will be used in a more sophisticated way in 2026.

Ferrari has also gained experience with a similar concept. The Scuderia tested its own prototype during a private mule-car test and has also brought its own system to Abu Dhabi.

Besides offering teams early insight into active aerodynamics, these prototypes also provide valuable data to Pirelli. The Italian tyre supplier can compare mule cars running without active front aerodynamics to those equipped with the system.

“Talking about the front Straight Line Mode, the FIA gave the opportunity to the teams to develop a system that was replicating this on the front wing. In that case, obviously, they don't have to comply with the speed limit restriction,” Pirelli’s Mario Isola explained. Mule cars have a speed limit of about 300km/h on straights to avoid overloading the tyres.

“It's also useful for us because you can compare a car that is running without the system with a car that is running with the system. When we did the first test with Ferrari with the system, it was really useful to understand and to compare this test with all the other tests, in terms of load and what we achieved, to understand and to make the other tests more representative.”

In addition to the active front wing, some teams are running wheel rims that form a hybrid solution between current rims and those planned for 2026.

“In some cases, teams ask for testing rims similar to the ones they are going to use next year, when they obviously have more freedom in designing the rim. And they have been authorized by the FIA to do a certain number of runs with the new rims.”

However, the results of those tests are not entirely representative for next year, as tyre heat management also heavily depends on the brakes – and the brakes will be different in 2026. All teams in Abu Dhabi are still running the current-spec brakes.

The 2025 Formula 1 competitive season may be over, but track activity is not: all 20 cars will be in action in  on Tuesday.

Each team will have one mule car driven by one or both race drivers, featuring Pirelli’s new range of rubber for the 2026 season, with slightly smaller and narrower tyres.

Even the tyres’ construction will be significantly different due to F1’s new technical regulations. When Pirelli asked all F1 teams to submit their predicted downforce levels for the end of 2026, there was much disparity between their simulations.

“It was more difficult for teams to estimate the performance of their 2026 cars at the end of the season,” Pirelli’s Mario Isola explained. “But we needed those simulations because we needed to design a product that is lasting for one year. If they just give us an idea of the car performance at the start of the season, and if we don't know what the rate of development will be, then it's difficult for us.”

Pirelli has therefore developed a broad spectrum of compounds, in case the real-world downforce levels turn out to be higher or lower than predicted by the teams.

The mule cars are 2025-spec machinery that has been modified to drop down closer to next year’s much lower downforce levels, though it cannot be fully accurate, partly because the 2026 cars will feature active aerodynamics.

“We have discussed some limitations with the teams, based on those first tests,” Isola added. “For example, we decided to avoid overloading the tyres on the straights. We were testing with a speed limit at 290km/h or 300km/h, because clearly they will have a lot less downforce on the straights next year. So we agreed on some methodologies for testing with the teams. Thanks to these methodologies it was possible to have feedback from the mule cars that was a little bit more coherent, more close.”

The test won’t change the 2026 compounds in any case, as the tyres have already been homologated for next season; it will simply help Pirelli choose the compounds for next year.

The Italian manufacturer has brought all compounds to Yas Marina Circuit except for the hardest dry-weather tyre, the C1, and the full-wet.

Meanwhile, the other 10 cars will be driven by rookies as part of the traditional end-of-season young drivers’ test. Only competitors with two grand prix starts or fewer are allowed to take part.

A number of 2025 race drivers will be skipping Tuesday's test.

The Finnish driver had returned to Mercedes for 2025 as a reserve driver after losing his seat at  at the end of 2024. Having previously driven for the squad between 2017 and 2021, Bottas claimed his return felt like reuniting with his family.

After a year out of a full-time seat, Bottas is set to return to the grid in 2026 with Cadillac, alongside former Red Bull driver , when the American outfit joins the paddock as the 11th team.

The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix marked Bottas's final race weekend with Mercedes. "Thank you, Mercedes," he posted on social media after the weekend came to a close.

"It was great to be back with the family this season during my ‘gap year’. This team always has a special place in my heart, and I really appreciate the opportunity to be the 3rd driver for the team. I now respect the team, the sport, and every personnel involved even more than before. Wishing you all the best for the future & see you around soon!"

Mercedes CEO and team principal Toto Wolff gave his full support to Bottas for a return to a full-time seat next year. "It is great to see Valtteri regain his place on the F1 grid for next year,” Wolff said at the time of Bottas signing with Cadillac.

"He still has so much to offer as a racing driver and deserves to be lining up in Melbourne for the 2026 season. We will of course be sad to see him go. He has played an important role in our team and his contribution as our third driver this year has been exemplary."

Cadillac wasted no time in welcoming the 36-year-old driver to the team ahead of its F1 entry. "The time is now," the General Motors-owned team posted.

A moment between  and  after the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix will hopefully bring to an end the online abuse the  rookie has been receiving since his mistake during the Qatar Grand Prix.

In a video shared by the Mercedes F1 social media team, the young driver can be seen approaching the four-time champion following the title-deciding race. The two shake hands as Antonelli apologises for the mistake he made in last weekend's race once again - a mistake that let now-Formula 1 champion  win by two points.

Verstappen listens with a smile on his face before shrugging off the episode with a smile as the two shake hands again. There is clearly no tension between the drivers.

The drama began at Losail, when Antonelli was chasing  for the final podium position of the Qatar Grand Prix. After several laps in the dirty air of the , he ran out of grip on the penultimate lap and went wide, letting Norris sweep through and capture fourth place and two extra points in his championship fight with the Dutchman.

"After so many laps in dirty air, I'm pushing so hard, the mistake arrived, because I obviously every lap I was pushing a bit more and more to get closer and I arrived to the point where the tyre gave up. At that moment I did a mistake and Lando passed me," he said. "Then after the race, to receive those kind of comments, definitely it hurt."

This error drew criticism from Red Bull as the team briefly believed it to be a purposeful move to allow Norris through, but these comments were quickly apologised for. Despite this, the abuse from fans of the championship was rife on social media.

Mercedes revealed that more than 1100 "severe or suspect" comments - several of them death threats - were flagged across Antonelli's social media accounts. And while Red Bull issued a formal statement confirming its accusations were incorrect, as well as comments mirroring this from across the paddock, the abuse continued into this weekend.

Following the Abu Dhabi race, the Italian was forced to turn comments off once again due to further abuse.

has been crowned Formula 1 world champion for the first time after securing a podium finish at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. This has unsurprisingly prompted warm praise from his fellow drivers on the grid, with long-term rival and friend  starting the trend.

Norris wrapped up the title at Yas Marina after a tense long race from the first corner. With his team-mate  overtaking the Briton at the beginning of the race, strong driving from Norris made sure he stayed within the top three, pulling away from the surging  driver  in the last stint of the race.

With a stronger and more consistent second half of the season, he was able to beat Red Bull's  to the championship by just two points.

For many in the paddock, his success started in karting across Europe, with several drivers joining him as they all fought for a place in the championship.

"No, I'm really happy for him. Honestly, maybe when I was a bit younger and not as mature I think you'd be envy of sort of a rival and fellow countryman to win, but honestly I think the older we get you recognise how difficult it is to sustain a certain level in this sport.

"We never know when our opportunity was going to come. I'm sure he wasn't aware his chance was going to be this year and this second half of the year, especially he's driven really incredibly, so I'm happy for him and I think he deserves it."

When asked if he planned to party with Norris to celebrate the title, Russell added:

"No, to be honest. But yeah, he should enjoy the moment."

"Lando, all three of them, you know, they drove amazingly well this year. And even now, with extra pressure in the last race, they qualified in the top three, they finished in the top three, so they still deliver the job.

"All three are world champions. Only one can win. This time was Lando. So yeah, congratulations to him. He has to enjoy now, you dream to become Formula 1 driver eventually, and then to win the championship that arrived for him, and I hope he enjoys it and well-deserved it."

"Yeah, very happy for him. It's great to see him showing his emotions on the world stage. I think he answered a lot of critics and I feel like he took a step. At the end of the year he rose under the pressure and he deserves every moment of this.

"He had quite a lot of bad luck actually, both McLaren's but particularly Lando's. He's done it in great style and I'm sure that's a lot of pressure off his shoulders. It's going to be a big night tonight, that's for sure."

Will Albon be joining him?

"I'm literally going to spend dinner with my family and go to bed."

He continued: "It's weird isn't it? It doesn't feel real. It feels like just your friends on the big stage. I guess we don't look at each other like fans may do. You're just happy as a friend more than you are as anything else.

"Clearly it's a dream for all of us to be an F1 world champion. I think we're all so happy for Lando. Hopefully everyone else gets a chance as well."

This article will be updated with more reactions.

"Yes, absolutely great, a well-deserved world champion. And Lando proved it again today, the whole weekend.

"Under this immense pressure, he made no mistakes, he delivered. Drove a perfect weekend — sensational and fantastic. And I really feel it with him.All the memories are coming back for me. That’s why I’m smiling so much — because I totally feel his emotions, and seeing his parents, and everything."

To what extent will it change Norris's life?

"It definitely affects your life, of course, being world champion. And I think it also gives you that next level of self-confidence. Because you’ve proven it — you’ve checked off that you have what it takes to be world champion.

"No one can ever take that away from you. So that really is another step in self-confidence. Maybe we’ll see an even stronger Lando Norris next year.

"Amazing three-way battle. I think they all deserve a lot this year. They were fighting until the end. We had an amazing show for that last race. There has to be only one champion and well done to Lando. I think he definitely deserves what he gets today. I'm super proud for him. I hope that he survives tonight's party."

"It was a tough battle. I think all three kind of deserve to be up there. You need one champion. There's always only one champion. I think for Formula 1, it's pretty incredible to have a title decided by two points. It's pretty amazing for the sport and for the fans out there. In the end, it's a massive moment for his career. A big congratulations to Lando."

I think that's a good place to leave it. Make sure to keep an eye out for our other post-race reaction, but let's give you one more Lando pic because this is his moment.

And who knows if he'll go back-to-back, because everything promises to look a lot different in the new era.

More from an emotional Norris on Sky: "It's pretty cool. It's pretty insane. It's hard for me just to say it. I feel like I don't want to say it just yet, I'll wake up tomorrow and say it. It's been a season of ups and downs - has it been a perfect season? Absolutely not. Has it been by anybody? No.

"I'm happy I cried. Not many things in my life have made me cry, but today was one."

Sky now showing a montage of Norris' career up to now. It's mad where the time has gone!

World champion at the age of 26 in his seventh season of F1.

This is a very sweet interview with Lando's mum on Sky. Speaks of watching her grandchild in the Nativity play on Tuesday before flying to Abu Dhabi on Thursday. Mentions of Lando being in the garden driving the tractor as a kid, before Hamilton is caught in the media pen congratulating Norris.

Carlos Sainz: "Very happy for him. I think he's a great F1 driver. I think unbelievably fast.

"But with his particular way of going about life and things, as much as he's got criticised a lot during the last few years for being how he is, he's world champion and everyone can keep dreaming about being F1 world champion while he goes about his own way and does things his own way.

"So I'm extremely happy for him because he must have felt a lot of pressure over the last few weekends and he managed to pull it off."

Let's hear more from Lando.

"It's incredible. Pretty surreal. I dreamed of this for a long, long time - everyone does - a lot goes into a season like this. A lot of ups, a lot of downs, but none of that matters if you try to come out on top. The last seven, eight years I've been with McLaren, the last 17, 18 years of my life I've been chasing this dream.

"My best performances this year came when I needed them the most."

The moment Lando crossed the line to become champion.

But queue the champagne, as Norris does his trademark celebration as a world champion for the first time!

Piastri lifts the runner-up trophy on the podium. It does look like he's trying to put on a brave face - a penny for his thoughts etc.

PR email of the day, dropped almost the second the grand prix finished. A street in Somerset, Lando's home county, will be named in his honour. It's almost like they had that planned and ready to go!

Norris: "I've not cried in a while. DIdn't think I'd cry but I did. It's a long journey, a long journey."

Speaking of the championship, here is how the top three finishes:

1. Lando Norris - 423 points

2. Max Verstappen - 421 points

3. Oscar Piastri - 410 points

It's hugmania on that pit straight. Zak, Sainz, Russell, mechanics, family, all wanting a bit of Lando.

But the cameras did catch a nice moment when Norris' mum headed over to Piastri to console the other McLaren driver, who finishes this year third in the championship.

As is customary in Abu Dhabi, Norris is now doing doughnuts down the start-finish straight...

Verstappen: "I'm definitely not disappointed. I'm proud of everyone, we never give up."

A tearful Norris: "I love you guys, thanks for everything - you deserve it. I love you mum, I love you dad."

Camera pans straight to the McLaren garage, where Lando's mum is crying. These moments are the ones to savour...

"Hi everyone, this is leaving an F1 team explained," he said to the camera as he pretended to wipe away tears from his eyes, "by Valtteri Bottas."

"In F1, leaving an F1 team obviously will happen eventually. It's quite sad. I've done it a few times in my career. It's not easy. But, if you think positively, in the end, there's 11 teams in the paddock next year. So we are all one big family and we are going to see each other again."

The video cuts to a montage of the driver hugging various members of the team accompanied by operatic music.

"Leaving a team is never easy. I just want to say thank you, Mercedes."

As the video fades to black, it cuts to a close-up of the Finn with the cameraman explaining they are going to need him to return the watch and team kit. The video once again cuts to a slow-motion montage of some of Bottas's best bits as a reserve driver with the same emotional music.
