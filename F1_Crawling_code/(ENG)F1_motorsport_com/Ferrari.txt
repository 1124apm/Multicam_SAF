Vettel was given a guard of honour by his Ferrari mechanics as he left his pit garage ahead of the race, which ended in disappointment for the Scuderia as both Vettel and teammate Charles Leclerc slipped back from their starting positions.

Ferrari announced back in May that Vettel would leave the team at the end of the 2020 season and he later signed a deal to replace Sergio Perez at the Racing Point squad that will become Aston Martin for next season.

"It was an emotional day," Vettel told Motorsport.com after the race at the Yas Marina track.

"I mean the result is nothing to mention, the race is nothing to mention, but yeah, I really enjoyed the little gestures starting from the beginning of the weekend.

[From] The mechanics, the engineers – all these people that I worked with for so long in those years, and so hard. So yeah, I shall miss a few of them very much.

"But it's good to be around [in F1 next season] and I'll get to see them."

Vettel also said that he was "happy obviously that the season is over" because "it was quite tough and tiring. I'm looking forward to the next one."

The German used the cool-down lap to sing his version of popular Italian song 'Azzurro' for Ferrari.

Vettel and Leclerc ran together in the early stages of the race after the latter's grid penalty meant they lined up alongside each other in P12 and P13 on the grid.

They were boosted up the order as Ferrari opted not to stop during the virtual safety car period triggered by Sergio Perez's retirement – which was later upgraded to a fully safety car – but the duo were overcome by the cars that had been running ahead of them and did chose to come as the race wore.

"At some stage obviously I struggled and the safety car didn't really help us because obviously we were on a mirror strategy to most of the cars," Vettel said of his race on Sunday.

"So, yeah, it didn't really work in our favour. But yeah, we still tried to hang in there as much as possible."

DATE: 2020

Ferrari has encountered a number of issues at pitstops this year, most recently at the Sakhir Grand Prix when Sebastian Vettel lost time due to slow stops.

Vettel said after the race in Bahrain that the pit equipment "probably needs an overhaul" after completing stops taking 4.5 seconds and 6.5 seconds.

The team revealed ahead of this weekend's season finale in Abu Dhabi that over 20% of its pitstops this year have taken over 3.5 seconds.

By comparison, Red Bull has regularly topped the pitstop times this season, achieving a sub-two second stop at four of the last seven races.

Ferrari acknowledged ahead of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix that its average pitstop time "is a long way off the best", and "there might have been a few more points on the scoreboard" with quicker services.

It has now revealed that a wheel nut issue has been identified as the root cause of the slow pitstops, with plans in place to rectify the problem for next year.

"It's true that the number of stops over 3.5 seconds is too high by the Scuderia's past standards, but the vast majority of times that there has been a less than optimal stop, it has been down to a specific problem linked to the wheel nut," said Diego Ioverno, Ferrari's vehicle operation engineer.

"The thread is not strong enough and so the nut has stripped several times. It's a reliability problem we are working hard on to fix for next year.

"When the guys feel, even unconsciously, that they are using a component that is more at risk, with a margin of error for engaging the wheel-gun that is much smaller, that has a negative effect on the whole procedure.

"That can be seen from the fact that for us, an average time for a good pitstop is 2.73 seconds, which means there is room for improvement there too."

Ioverno also explained that the Ferrari pit crew is "relatively new" as part of Ferrari's ongoing restructuring and rebuild, and would take time to gel together.

"It is clear therefore that it takes a little time for all those involved in the pitstop to gel," he said.

"There is no other sport that calls on perfect synchronisation of over twenty people. That's why the best teams are the ones that have used the same crew for several years.

"So, apart from reliability, we also need to work on this area, both through specific training sessions and psychological and physical training and that will be another priority over the winter in preparation for 2021."

DATE: 2020

Leclerc slumped to 12th place in qualifying on Saturday at the Bahrain International Circuit, losing out in Q2 to Ferrari teammate Sebastian Vettel, who will start one place ahead in 11th.

It marked just the fourth time this year that Vettel has managed to outqualify Leclerc, who has led Ferrari’s efforts through much of the season so far.

For Leclerc, it was a further turnaround in fortunes given he took his maiden F1 pole position in Bahrain last year and was on course to win the race prior to an engine issue.

Mekies said that Leclerc appeared to lack his normal level of confidence with the SF1000 car in Bahrain so far this weekend.

“I’m sure if you ask him, he will probably tell you that he doesn’t have his usual level of confidence as he’s had around here,” Mekies said.

“We are working hard with the team to try to support him best, to give him the tools and give him the car he needs to have that.

“I think there was some small progress. We did see this level of confidence growing. We are missing something for qualy today.

“Hopefully with the race tomorrow, we are back in the fight.”

Ferrari scored its best two-car result of the season so far last time out in Turkey as Vettel and Leclerc finished third and fourth respectively.

The result gave Ferrari a boost in its bid to move up from its current placing of sixth in the constructors’ championship, only for its midfield rivals to then qualify further up the order in Bahrain.

Mekies was braced for a close fight in Sunday’s race, believing as many as 12 cars would be evenly-matched in the midfield tussle.

“What you saw in qualy in terms of how close you have these 12 cars together, I think you will see a lot of in the race,” Mekies said.

“You always have a few guys that manage it better, a few guys that manage it worse, and therefore the gap spreads a little bit. But I expect a very, very tight fight.

“We have tried to approach quite race-focused. We have saved two sets of hards. There are a few cars in that situation but not so many. We will see if we need them tomorrow or if that pays off.

“But we are gearing up for a good fight with 12 cars tomorrow.”

DATE: 2020

Binotto and Wolff clashed earlier this year in the wake of the secret deal that was put in place between the FIA and Ferrari regarding legality doubts over the Maranello team’s 2019 powerunit.

Wolff was  that all teams had been impacted by technical directives regarding engines – so Ferrari wasn’t alone in being caught out.

“Another complete bullshit story, technical directives,” said Wolff. “There's a clear regulation on power units.”

Wolff has also said that he felt sad that Ferrari had endured difficulties this year because of choices made by certain individuals there.

“It’s maybe the decisions that have been made within the team, from certain members of the team,” he claimed.

But while the relationship between the Mercedes and Ferrari bosses has appeared to be quite tense, Binotto does not see any particular tension between them.

“Do we ‘hate’ each other,” said Binotto in an interview with Sky Italia, when asked about his relationship with Wolff.

“In a sporting respect, he is my main opponent who has been winning for many years. But it is not hatred.

“There is respect and a desire to beat him, but not for the sake of beating Toto and Mercedes. It’s to bring Ferrari back to the top, and the place where it deserves to be.”

Binotto insisted that there was nothing underhand about the deal Ferrari reached with the FIA over the winter, and is clear that if rivals had been unhappy with his team’s engine last year then the door was always open to them to protest.

“No opponent last year filed a protest against us,” he said. “What was done later [after the season] started from the FIA’s desire to continue its investigations and analysis at a time when we were focused on developing the car for the 2020 season.

“We thus reached a simple agreement: let us focus on the future, let us help each other to understand what are the possible grey areas in the rules. And where clarifications were needed, clarifications were made.

"The agreement was secret because it was obvious it should be. Should we have shown everyone our engine?

“I don't think anyone has ever done that in Formula 1, and no one will ever do that in the future.

“With regards to the 'grey' area, it was like that throughout the 2019 season until new directives arrived, and they were also defined thanks to our help.

“These directives had an impact on all engines, but on us to a greater extent."

Despite Ferrari’s difficult season, Binotto says the response in Maranello has been the right one – with the staff having come together amid its troubles rather than trying to blame each other.

"It's a fantastic group of people,” said Binotto. “We are going through a difficult period, and in such a context it is easy for tensions to arise, to point the finger at your desk neighbour.

“Instead, we are a compact team that is working with only one goal, plus we have the support of our president and CEO.

“We believe in this sport and in the future. It is a Ferrari that despite a not easy sporting moment, and with all the difficulties that the COVID period has entailed, has solid foundations on which to build and look forward.”

DATE: 2020

Ferrari has struggled for pace throughout the 2020 F1 season, languishing down in sixth place in the constructors’ championship due to both aerodynamic and engine deficits.

In a bid to rectify its aerodynamic issues, the Maranello outfit has developed a wide array of upgrades, which it has rolled out over the past two weeks. Upgrades introduced at the Russian and Eifel grands prix .

At this weekend’s Portuguese GP, Ferrari will complete the set of upgrades with a new diffuser. “We already introduced a few small modifications to the car’s aero package in Sochi and added others at the Nurburgring,” Ferrari’s Head of Performance Development Enrico Cardile explained.

“In Portimao we will have a further update, mainly to the diffuser, completing the programme set out over the past few months.”

Ferrari’s previous updates were deemed a relative success on the evidence of Charles Leclerc taking fourth in qualifying on the Nurburgring and finishing seventh, backing up a sixth-place finish in Sochi.

According to team boss Mattia Binotto the upgrades were not expected to deliver huge performance gains, but showed the Italian squad was .

Cardile hopes Ferrari will “get confirmation” at Portimao that its development is “on the right track” after being plagued by correlation issues in the Maranello windtunnel.

"Indications from the past few grands prix are positive and we hope the same will apply this weekend," Cardile added. "We have to consider that, more than ever this year, development is aimed at the following season.

"All the same, we still expect to see a performance improvement with the SF1000. It would be very useful to at least find ourselves heading the group of cars and drivers currently fighting within just a few tenths for places four and lower.”

For 2021, F1 teams are only allowed a limited redevelopment of the current car, which will also undergo a downforce cut as mandated by the tweaked technical regulations.

Ferrari  that it will spend its entire allowance of two development tokens for the 2021 season on the rear of its troubled car.

Cardile explained that Ferrari, which is also working on a new power unit, is targeting a rear-end revamp because it "offers the biggest margin for improvement”.

"I say that not just because it’s the area of the car where pretty significant changes have been introduced in the technical regulations, but also we believe that because of the way our car is laid out, we could really make significant progress,” he said. "That’s why we’ve decided to spend our two tokens allowed in the rules in this very area.

"When we look at the standings, seeing ourselves down in sixth place hurts and we are well aware that it is not a position worthy of Ferrari. We absolutely want to improve, for us and for our fans who still support us with passion, even at difficult times like the ones we are going through now.”

DATE: 2020

Vettel joined Ferrari in 2015 with the target of emulating his childhood hero Michael Schumacher and bring another world title to Maranello.

The four-time world champion finished runner-up in the championship in both 2017 and 2018 and scored 14 wins with Ferrari, but following a disappointing 18-month period Ferrari decided it would not renew Vettel's expiring contract after the 2020 season and bring in McLaren’s Carlos Sainz as his replacement.

Vettel, who will replace Sergio Perez at , stated he had no regrets about his five-year spell at Ferrari, but admitted his time at the Italian team was a failure.

"It is true that I have failed because I set myself the mission or the target to win the championship with Ferrari,” Vettel said on the F1 podcast Beyond the Grid. "I have failed. I didn't manage to do that.”

The German didn’t manage to thrive in the highly political environment at Maranello and concedes he could have done some things differently behind the scenes.

“There's things that I should have done better, things that maybe I should have seen earlier, fights that maybe I shouldn't have picked,” he explained.

"But, then again, I think everything that happened brought me to where I am now. If I'm fair and harsh then I have failed. Were there reasons? Probably yes, but I don't accept them as excuses. So, whatever happened also put me on the next step forward and next level.”

“Maybe [the fights] weren't worth fighting, but then again part of it is probably my nature. And I think I had a point as well in some of these little fights and battles. But I think ultimately that's how you mature and how you learn. I'm happy to move on.”

Vettel is looking forward to his fresh start at Aston Martin, the new identity of the current Racing Point outfit, working with what will be a much smaller team than Ferrari.

The 33-year-old said he is relishing a new challenge at a “fun project” after being convinced to join by owner Lawrence Stroll and explained there are a lot of factors that made him join the Silverstone team.

"I think those boxes were quite easy to tick in terms of the performance, the racing side of things, where the team is, where the team might be, the potential and so on,” he added.

"And it sounds like a fun project, and something that ultimately I decided I want to be part of. It is very different to Ferrari, obviously Racing Point as it stands today and in the future Aston Martin will be growing.

"There will be a lot of things happening for the first time, and I think it's an incredible challenging journey for the whole team. And me joining I hope I can contribute a lot of things and do good in the car and outside the car."

DATE: 2020

As  earlier this week, Ferrari will honour its 1000th race by running a special classic livery design for the Tuscan Grand Prix.

Ferrari announced on Wednesday that both SF1000 cars driven by Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel will race in the burgundy shade that was used on the Ferrari 125 cars the team made its debut with in 1950.

Both Leclerc and Vettel will have special race suits for the race weekend, tying in with the classic livery, which also has retro numbering and a ‘1000 GP’ logo on the engine cover.

“Scuderia Ferrari’s 1000th Grand Prix is a very important milestone, therefore it had to be marked in a special way,” said Piero Ferrari, vice-chairman of Ferrari.

“That’s why we decided to run a unique livery on the cars for this event, with the SF1000s taking to the track at the Mugello Circuit in the Burgundy colour first seen on the 125, the first racing car to carry the Ferrari name.

“Even the look of the race numbers on Charles’ and Sebastian’s cars will reflect the tradition of the past, giving the impression of being hand painted onto the bodywork, while the drivers’ race suits will also match the car colour.”

“It’s a great honour to be driving a Ferrari in what is the 1000th Grand Prix for this, the longest serving of all Formula 1 teams,” said four-time world champion Vettel.

“It will be even more of a pleasure to celebrate this anniversary at the Mugello Circuit and also because, for the first time this season, a few spectators will be allowed into the grandstands.”

The Tuscan Grand Prix will be the first race of the 2020 season that fans are able to attend, with close to 3,000 tickets being made available for the event.

"I can't wait to be on track at Mugello with Ferrari,” said Leclerc. “The circuit is really beautiful and on top of that, we are celebrating our team’s 1000th GP in Formula 1. I’m also pleased to learn there will be a few thousand fans in the grandstands.”

As part of the celebrations, Ferrari junior driver Mick Schumacher will take part in a show run in a Ferrari F2004 - the car his father, Michael, won his record-setting seventh world title - ahead of the race on Sunday.

Ferrari will also hold an event in Florence on Saturday night to mark its 1000th grand prix.

Mercedes will also honour Ferrari’s 1000th race with a colour change of its own, changing the safety car from silver to red.

“The Tuscan Grand Prix will also be the 1000th F1 race for Ferrari, marking the long racing tradition of this great Italian brand,” said Mercedes F1 team principal Toto Wolff.

“We will honour this achievement with a Mercedes-AMG Safety Car in Ferrari red - our nod to a racing history that brought us some of the greatest moments in Formula 1.

“The men and women of Maranello have a proud history to celebrate and we're paying respect to those celebrations this weekend.”

DATE: 2020

The Italian outfit has fallen away from the front of the field in 2020, and faced a bruising outing in Belgium last weekend which was one of its least competitive showings for years.

The difficulties the team has faced in 2020, with its engine having lost power and its car too draggy, have prompted some to suggest that Ferrari needs change at the top.

But while Binotto knows he has complete support from Ferrari’s senior management, so was never worried by such talk, he has revealed that he did ponder his own position.

Asked in an interview with Corriere della Sera if he ever felt his position was in danger, Binotto said: "Honestly never, because I know I have the support of my managers. But I questioned myself. I thought about whether I was suitable for the role of team principal.”

Binotto said that he eventually concluded that he had what it takes to help turn things around for Ferrari, even though he accepted that he had perhaps not done everything perfectly.

“I could have done better in some areas, for example the technical reorganisation could have been done earlier,” he said. “But I believe that my 25 years in F1, and the knowledge of this company, are key elements to do well in this job.”

Ferrari reshuffled its technical structure earlier this year so that Binotto could step away from his heavy involvement in that area and better concentrate on areas that needed more time devoted to them.

Allied to the discussions over framing a new Concorde Agreement, Binotto said that perhaps he had taken on too much – which had meant some aspects of the team had not got the attention they deserved.

"As team principal, the first role is not technical,” he said. “We worked on the renewal of Charles [Leclerc], on [Carlos] Sainz's recruitment and on many other fronts.

"It may be that in having less technical [focus] we were not sufficiently organised with delegating, but let's not forget that I became team principal without notice a year and a half ago. It takes time, all the winning cycles have shown this.

“When I think back to Ferrari in 1995 and 2000, many things changed. This reorganisation will not be the last.”

Binotto also says that while Ferrari CEO Louis Camilleri and chairman John Elkann have very different personalities to the late Sergio Marchionne, they are not as distant as some have suggested.

"It's one of the most wrong things I hear,” added Binotto. “I am not alone, I can assure you. I get their advice, surely their style of leadership is different from what we were used to in the past. But I am not alone. I am just not.”

DATE: 2020

Ferrari has endured a miserable start to the season that has seen the team slump to fifth place in the constructors' championship, sitting just two points clear of Renault.

Last weekend's Belgian Grand Prix  in 2020 as it spent just five laps running inside the top 10, with both Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel failing to score any points.

Ferrari is expecting to struggle once again this weekend at Monza given the high-speed nature of the circuit and its current straight-line speed deficit.

The team has made no secret of the task it faces to turn things around, with

Ricciardo's name has been repeatedly linked to a seat at Ferrari in recent years, but will join McLaren for 2021 to replace Carlos Sainz, who was snapped up by Ferrari to replace Sebastian Vettel.

Sainz has defended his decision to leave McLaren to move to Ferrari for next year despite the team's struggles, saying he is "100% sure" it was the right call.

Asked if he felt like he had dodged a bullet by not joining Ferrari given its current struggles, Ricciardo said that while he had not thought too deeply about it, he was surprised by how far it had fallen.

"It's tough to know really how long this string of results will last for the team," said Ricciardo. "I find it hard to see it lasting too long, but at the same time, I didn't expect to see the results or for them to struggle as much as I have, at least in Spa.

"It was talked about before the weekend that they were going to have a hard time, and it proved very much to be the case. They certainly are in a bit of a spot at the moment.

"I didn't really think that far ahead, if, what, how, why it would look [if I'd joined Ferrari]. From that point of view I can't really answer it. But I'm sure they will learn a lot from this year, and I'm sure they will pick themselves up in a better place for next year."

Ricciardo enjoyed his strongest race since joining Renault at the start of last year in Belgium, finishing fourth and picking up the bonus point for the fastest lap.

Teammate Esteban Ocon followed Ricciardo home in fifth place, marking Renault's biggest one-race points haul since returning to F1 as a works team in 2016.

Renault now sits just nine points of third place in the constructors' standings as it continues on an upward trajectory. But Ricciardo said there was no regret that he was helping the team move forward before leaving at the end of the year.

"Not at all," he said. "I'm certainly keen to keep this train moving, and try and stand on the steps this year.

"I'll put everything I can into it, and next year's another story."

Since the delayed start to the 2020 Formula 1 season in Austria at the start of July, all F1 races have been run behind closed doors without any spectators as part of the strict event protocols.

Plans are in place for close to 3,000 fans to attend the Tuscan Grand Prix at Mugello next week, which will be the first event where tickets are available for purchase. But it has been revealed that hundreds of fans will be in the grandstands at Monza this weekend as a token of thanks to the doctors and nurses who played a role in the fight against COVID-19.

Italy was one of the hardest-hit countries in Europe in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, with an estimated 35,000 deaths since the outbreak began. The 250 frontline workers will be guests of the Automobile Club d’Italia, which is the promoter of the Italian Grand Prix.

“Like all the other races run so far this year, the Italian Grand Prix will be held behind closed doors and therefore there will be no traditional track invasion by the fans at the end of the race,” stated Ferrari in its pre-race preview.

“However, there will be 250 very special people in the grandstands, socially distanced of course: doctors and nurses will be guests at the track, as a symbolic honour for their courage, sense of duty and altruism as front line workers in the fight against COVID-19.”

Ferrari is braced for a difficult home race weekend at Monza amid ongoing struggles with the SF1000 car that saw it fail to score any points in the Belgian Grand Prix last Sunday. Charles Leclerc took Ferrari’s first Italian Grand Prix victory in nine years last season, but said the team was set for a “difficult weekend” this time around.

“All the same, we are not lacking motivation for this round,” Leclerc said. “We will all pull together to bring home the best possible result.”

Teammate Sebastian Vettel added: “We come to Monza knowing it’s going to be tough to be a frontrunner this weekend. The last race here was anything but straightforward for me and we are well aware that will also be the case this time.

“We have a specific aero package that we hope will make the SF1000 more competitive. Nevertheless our aim this weekend is the same as always: to make the most of our package and bring home as many points as possible.”

McLaren moved up to third place in the constructors’ championship at last weekend’s Belgian Grand Prix after Lando Norris finished the race in seventh place.

The result lifted McLaren above Racing Point and extended its advantage over fifth-placed Ferrari, who failed to score any points and spent just five laps with a car inside the top 10.

Ferrari has struggled for form through 2020 so far amid aerodynamic issues with its SF1000 car and a lack of straight-line speed from its power unit.

With this weekend’s Italian Grand Prix set to be a difficult one for Ferrari-powered teams given the high-speed nature of the track, it gives McLaren an opportunity to widen the gap to the Italian marque in the constructors’ standings.

McLaren F1 chief Seidl is anticipating a tight fight with Racing Point and Renault at Monza, but said it was important not to write off Ferrari’s ability to fight back this year.

“I expect to be close again to the Racing Points and the Renaults,” Seidl said.

“Everything we can see here at the moment and take away from here, and also reading the comments from Ferrari, they may struggle there as well.

“So hopefully once again it is an opportunity to score more points than we did here. That gives us another good opportunity to score good points compared to some of the competitors that will be stronger again at other tracks.

“Something important and we never do [is] we cannot underestimate the ability of Ferrari to strike back during the course of the season because of their experience, the manpower, and the infrastructure.

“I am sure it is only a matter of time before they will strike back again as well. That’s why it hurts even more that we didn’t collect even more points [at Spa].”

McLaren currently sits seven points clear of Ferrari in the teams’ standings, with Renault a further two points behind Ferrari.

Seidl said he rued the fact McLaren had just one car in the race after Carlos Sainz was unable to take the start due to a power unit issue that caused an exhaust failure.

Despite a disappointing run to 14th on a weekend where Ferrari did not have much pace, Vettel was determined to do something special in his final outing for the Maranello team.

On his slow down lap after the chequered flag, as his team thanked him for all he had brought to the Maranello squad, he told them over the radio that he had a surprise.

In Italian he said: “You know that sometimes I like to sing, so I thought of singing one last time a song for you.”

Then, pulling out a sheet of paper with some lyrics that he had hidden in his cockpit, he sang to the tune of a famous Italian song from the 1960’s, Azzurro.

You’ll never surrender

I loved being with you

I felt your magic, an extraordinary feeling

Guys, I thank you, for having me

I will miss all of you

Greetings to all of you in Maranello,

You deserve to be mentioned here

And now I’ll say goodbye, and wish you all the best

I wish you to be happy but above all, to be healthy

Speaking after the race about why he chose to sign his Ferrari career off with a song, he said: “Obviously, I've had a lot of highs with the whole team, and every time I was really excited, for some reason I started to sing.

“So I think it was a nice way, for one last time, to sing again. And obviously the song that I leave them to is a very, very popular Italian song Azzurro from Adriano Celentano.

“I changed the lyrics, so I hope I don't get in trouble with copyright. But yeah, I think it was a good way to express the gratitude for the team."

Vettel had been given a tunnel of applause by his Ferrari crew as he left the garage for the last time ahead of the Abu Dhabi GP, and was later presented with a huge trophy from the team.

Speaking about that memento, he said: “I was surprised myself. Obviously I've never finished P14 before and got a trophy. So it will definitely be a good nice memory.

“There was also a sign at the front [of the garage] with all the wins. This year has been in a way a total reflection of the great time that I had with the team.”

Leclerc has adopted a largely white helmet colour scheme for the final race of the 2020 season, which mirrors the design Vettel has used throughout his six years at Ferrari – albeit with Monaco flag colours running over the top in place of the Germany equivalent his teammate uses.

The words ‘Danke, Seb’ are written on top of Leclerc’s helmet, which also features images of the two drivers, who have been teammates since the start of 2019 when Leclerc joined Ferrari from Sauber, during their time as colleagues at the Maranello marque.

Speaking after qualifying at the Yas Marina track, Leclerc explained to Motorsport.com why he had made the gesture.

“Seb has given so much to the team, which will benefit me indirectly because I’ve got a long contract with the team,” said Leclerc.

“And most of all, as soon as I arrived in the team, he welcomed me in the best way possible.

“Sure, there was some competition, but as a human being he is a great guy. So, I just wanted to show him my respect that way and I know he liked it.”

Vettel will start his final race for Ferrari – where he has scored 14 wins and 11 poles in what is expected to be a final race start total for the Scuderia of 118 – in P13.

"Obviously it is not nice to start my final race with the team from 13th on the grid,” he said after qualifying at the Yas Marina track.

“The result itself is quite bad, even if I was happy with my own performance on the lap.

“Maybe putting together the perfect lap would have got me as high as 10th, but no better than that.

“My plan for the race is simply to try and do my best. I guess we won’t have an easy race.

“I think it will be special since it is the last one.

“I want to enjoy this race and feel very close to the people in the garage, the mechanics, the engineers, everyone. It will be very emotional."

Leclerc, who also went into qualifying at the Yas Marina track with a three-place grid penalty hanging over his result thanks to his clash with Sergio Perez and Max Verstappen on the first lap of last weekend’s Sakhir GP, failed to recreate his best laps from Q1 and Q2 in the top 10 shootout.

The Monegasque driver did manage to get through on the advantageous medium tyres in Q2, but could not recreate his form on the softs in Q1 – where he was only behind the Mercedes duo, Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas, and ahead of eventual pole-winner, Verstappen.

When asked how vital it had been to progress through to Q3 on the mediums, which were lasting much longer than the red-walled softs on long runs in practice for the Abu Dhabi race, Leclerc told Motorsport.com that “it was important” before offering his thoughts on his Q3 form.

“I’m a bit disappointed because I wished we could do something more in Q3, which we didn’t,” he continued, after going 0.184s slower in the final segment than he had in Q1.

“We struggled a lot more in Q3 with tyre temperatures for some reason. So, we need to understand that, but happy to have gone through to Q3 with the medium.”

Leclerc explained that the problem was down to “keeping [the tyres] cool towards the end of the lap”.

He added: “We were struggling with overheating in the last sector and that made us lose quite a bit of laptime.”

Leclerc’s penalty means he will line up for the final race of the 2020 season in P12 on the grid, behind Renault duo Esteban Ocon and Daniel Ricciardo, who were eliminated in the middle phase of qualifying and are free to pick their starting race rubber.

“I don’t think it’s that bad at the end [to be starting behind the Renaults], because we would have chosen medium if we had free choice,” said Leclerc.

“So, luckily, we did a good job in Q2, which helps us to start on our preferred tyre.

“It would have been a lot more difficult [on be starting the softs] because… well, I could have had an advantage for two laps.

“But after that we all know that they are dropping quite a lot [with degradation].”

Vettel joined Ferrari in 2015, and finished runner-up to Lewis Hamilton in both 2017 and 2018. He also won 14 races for the team, putting him third in Maranello’s all-time list, behind title winners Michael Schumacher (72) and Niki Lauda (15).

Despite logging respectable statistics over his six years of an era dominated by Mercedes, Vettel says it wasn’t enough, having missed out on the big prize.

“It still doesn't change anything,” he said. “We've still failed. We had the ambition and target to win the championship. And we didn't, so I think it's just an honest reflection. I don't think saying it out loud changes anything.

“Probably we were up against a very strong team/driver combination, one of the strongest we've seen so far. But our goal was to be stronger than that. And in this regard, we have failed. Like I’ve said, there are reasons for it.

“We've had good races, bad races, we've got close, sometimes we're far away. There's a lot of reasons why, but in the big picture, I think it's not unfair, it's just the truth. Nothing wrong with saying it out loud.”

Vettel downplayed the impact of the pressure of representing Ferrari and living up the expectations of the tifosi.

“I don't know if I buy into the pressure thing, I think pressure you put on yourself,” he noted. “So as I said, I had the clear mission and target to win.

“I think I have obviously an emotional attachment to the team, growing up seeing Michael win, etcetera. So it was a very special moment when I joined the team.

“But the pressure thing, I think also the fact of the pressure in Italy, the fans and so on, yes, it is there. But ultimately I always set the highest sort of expectations on myself, and I think I was the first and best judge if I didn't achieve them.

“So rest assured that, when I stuffed the car in the gravel in Germany [in 2018], I wasn't happy before the tifosi weren't happy.

“I think it sounds nice, and it adds a little bit of drama to everything. But I'm definitely not holding that as an excuse for coming short here and there. I think if you are ambitious to win, and you have the target to win and to succeed, then you're the first one to realise that yourself, and it isn't depending on the pressure from outside.

“But having said that, everybody's different. But for me it wasn't the one thing holding us or holding me back.”

Vettel insisted that his Hockenheim accident in 2018 wasn’t a turning point in his relationship with the team.

“No, I think it was a pretty much a rollercoaster ride over the years with a lot of things happening. In terms of momentum in that year, it wasn't helping. The mistake was a little mistake, but a huge outcome, and a huge penalty.

“But there were definitely more things happening I think in the 2018 season. We've had the passing of Mr [Sergio] Marchionne, the change in leadership from Maurizio [Arrivabene] to Mattia [Binotto], so maybe the '18 year was a decisive year for many things.

“But I don't know if you can really break it down to only one thing. Obviously in 2016 we parted ways with James [Allison], because of personal conflicts at the time. And I think that looking back there were a lot of things that we should have and could have done better.

“But everything that happened happened for a reason. The main thing I think, on my side is to make sure that I learned from it, and I think I have grown with it, somewhere, moments on the track, like you mentioned in Germany or Hockenheim. Other moments were off the track.

“So overall, I think I feel much more comfortable or in a better place now than than those years ago, but certainly at the time, it hasn't always been been easy and straightforward.”htforward.”

Vettel vented his frustration over team radio over Leclerc’s move at the first corner following the second standing start in Bahrain on Sunday, feeling he was not left enough room.

Following a pass up the inside by Leclerc, Vettel said on team radio: “Not again! He can't just do that, as if I wasn't there.

“It's the same as Austria, seriously. This time, I should have crashed, maybe [that] was the better option.”

A move by Leclerc on the opening lap of the Styrian Grand Prix resulted in contact between the two Ferrari drivers, forcing both to retire from the race.

Leclerc went on to score a point for 10th place in Bahrain, while Vettel finished 13th after reporting that his car felt undriveable at times.

Leclerc and Vettel confirmed after the race in Bahrain that they had spoken about the incident, with Leclerc feeling it was a different situation to Austria.

“We spoke about it,” said Leclerc. “On my side, the only thing I can say is that surely it was extremely tight, but on the other hand, not like in Styria, where I didn’t put myself in a visible place.

“This time I tried to go further for him to see me. There was very little gap, but I went for it, and I made sure that he saw me.

“You can argue there was probably not enough gap between our cars being in the same team, but yeah, that’s it.”

Vettel said that Ferrari “don’t need to make a big deal out of it”, feeling he and Leclerc can move on quickly.

“Obviously it was tight,” Vettel said. “Arguably if you have three cars in the first corner, then at times, it works, and most of the time it doesn't work.

“We spoke about it so we can move on, it’s not a big deal.”

After enjoying its best two-car result of the season in Turkey two weeks earlier by finishing third and fourth, Ferrari slumped to the rear of the midfield in Bahrain as it struggled to compete for points.

Ferrari sporting director Laurent Mekies felt its downturn in form was not a result of its engine power deficit, instead citing the warmer conditions compared to recent races as a possible factor.

“I don’t think it’s all down to engine power at all,” Mekies said. “It’s true that compared to the last three or four races, we have lost some edge in the midfield, and if you lose a bit of edge, it’s enough to switch from extremes.

“It’s been painful from that perspective. If you consider the whole environment, we are certainly very different to what we have been facing in the last three or four races in Europe with colder, wet weather.

“Hopefully there is a way to unlock a bit more compared to what we’ve done this weekend, that’s what we’ll be trying again next week.”

Vettel qualified 11th at the Bahrain International Circuit on Saturday night, narrowly missing out on a place in Q3 after struggling on his final lap.

It marked the 11th race in a row where Vettel has failed to make it through to Q3, with the German sounding frustrated over team radio upon learning of the result.

But Vettel did manage to outqualify Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc, who could only finish 12th overall.

"It was very tough and tight," Vettel said. "I think Sector 2 wasn't ideal, I was too close to George [Russell], maybe that didn't help, and I was struggling after the stop and go in the final sector to get the fronts really to work.

"Maybe there was a little bit more [time], so Sector 2 was for sure not super clean. Overall I think it's more or less where we belong this weekend.

"Tomorrow is the race, and in the race it's not about one lap, so we'll see what we can do."

Drivers have been struggling with tyre management throughout the Bahrain weekend so far, prompting all of the top 10 to decide to qualify on the medium compound tyre.

Vettel said there would be a big "tyre battle" for Ferrari, meaning it had to be canny with its strategy if it wished to score points.

"This track is very rough, very tough on tyres, and that will be the key tomorrow to manage those," Vettel said.

"I think if we are sly as a fox, we have a good chance. If not, then it will be a long race. I still believe that there is a good chance to score some points."

Leclerc felt there was "definitely a bit more" time to find during his lap after ailing to his second straight Q2 exit.

"You can always do better, but I think that's the case for everyone," Leclerc said.

"At Turn 4 I think I lost quite a bit, but yeah, it's like this, we'll start P11 and P12, the first ones to have a free tyre choice.

"I don't know how much we can benefit from that, because I'm pretty sure that starting on the medium for the top 10 is not so bad.

"But yeah, we did our best, and today that's what was possible."

DATE: 2021

With the overhaul of the technical regulations on the horizon for 2022 and limited car development allowed for this year, F1's most successful and famous team was able to spend much of this season focusing on getting the basics right.

It resulted in a season that showed impressive steps forward by Ferrari in pretty much every metric. The team rose from sixth to third in the constructors' championship, scoring 192.5 more points, and picked up two poles and five podiums.

Drivers Carlos Sainz and  were fifth and seventh in the drivers' standings, securing a double-points finish for the team in 17 out of 22 races. Ferrari's only point-less grand prix came in France, when tyre management woes reared their head in the race.

But the stats that prove Ferrari is on the road to recovery go beyond the basic points figures.

Regardless of the lack of pace that hamstrung Ferrari through 2020, race execution was one of its weakest areas. The team even went as far as admitting last December that its pitstops were "a long way off the best", and had been hampered by a season-long issue with the wheelnuts being used.

In 2020, just 48% of Ferrari's pitstops were less than three seconds (the metric used by the team to define a good, consistent pitstop) to leave it ninth out of the 10 F1 teams.

But through 2021, this figure rose to 73%, putting Ferrari third on the grid. The team also improved its average pitstop time from 2.72 seconds to 2.55 seconds.

"We've done quite a huge programme to try and turn things around, both on the car, because there are some technical elements that we are driving that brought results, and on the guys with the training and the methodology we are using," explained Ferrari sporting director Laurent Mekies.

"Now today, on the criteria, we are third, and not by mistake, we are third in the points. So I think it's a good representation of how background work leads to better executions, and that applies to pitstops, that applies to tyre management, that applies to race strategy, that applies to many things."

While Ferrari may not have been fighting for wins or the championship this year, the team treated its fight with McLaren for third in the standings as its own title battle. The two teams were evenly-matched throughout the year, but a strong end to the season gave Ferrari P3 by 47.5 points.

"It's key that a close championship fight like that, when it's points for points, your execution needs to be top level," said Mekies.

"This year was no excuse. And therefore for us, even if the car was not as fast as what we would wish, we took that fight as if it was for the world championship."

The need to improve race execution was something that Sainz noticed upon arrival at Ferrari from McLaren, a team which used its recent nadir as a time to sharpen its operations without the pressure of battling for the highest stakes.

"For me, this was a big, big thing," Sainz told Motorsport.com. "When I arrived to the team at the beginning of the season, I really felt like we had to make progress in the way that we execute the race in strategy and tyre management. The first races were very difficult with that.

"I really felt strong progress throughout the season on that. The car was performing maybe a bit better, but not more than a tenth better than at the beginning of the season. You see how consistent we are now on race execution, and it's another story compared to a beginning."

The improvement in race operations was also evident through Ferrari's improved reliability through 2021. The team went from six DNFs in 2020 to just one in 2021 - plus Leclerc's DNS in Monaco after his qualifying crash - and recorded more top-10 finishes than any other team.

But the raw pace of the car is where Ferrari needed to take a step forward after its disastrous 2020 campaign. Not only did the team manage to get back in contention with the leading midfield teams, giving it third in the standings, but also cut the gap to Mercedes.

According to Ferrari's data, the average gap in qualifying to Mercedes fell from 1.34 seconds in 2020 to 0.64 seconds in 2021. This gap was as small as 0.4 seconds at the start of the year, but gradually grew as the season wore on.

"We are fully aware we have not closed the gap to the best, and 0.6s is still a big number," said Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto.

"But the objective was to try to reduce the gap. We were fully aware of the situation of 2020, and I think that being realistic, it was impossible to close the gap."

Ferrari's gains in race pace were smaller, yet still showed signs of decent progress: the average gap to Mercedes fell from 1.1 seconds to 0.8 seconds. Binotto called it "still a significant gap", but pointed to the fact Ferrari had not developed its car much through the season as it placed focus on 2022.

"That's showing that we didn't really develop our car, while maybe others did," Binotto said. "I think in terms of pure design and development through the winter time, what has been achieved is from 1.3 to 0.4 seconds.

"Further in the season, the gap increases because as a choice from Ferrari, we were fully focused on 2022, except the power unit. This is correlating with these numbers. It's again showing in numbers that we're reducing the gap to the competitors."

It all makes for encouraging reading for Ferrari as it gears up for the incoming regulations in 2022. The team proved its strength in terms of making gains over the winter, sharpened up its race operations, and has one of the strongest driver line-ups out there.

The challenge now for Ferrari will be to put everything together this winter so it can capitalise on the new regulations, and take the fight to Mercedes and Red Bull once again.

DATE: 2021

The Maranello-based outfit recovered from a dire 2020 campaign to finish third in the constructors’ championship this year.

And with a rules reset coming for 2022, the team is hoping that the opportunity afforded by the start of the new era can give it the chance to get back to winning ways.

Speaking from Maranello as he looked forward to next season, team principal Mattia Binotto said that new processes – including being open to adopting different idea – has led to  pushing the boundaries with its new challenger.

“If I look at the 2022 car, and the 2022 power unit, believe me there is a lot of innovation in it,” he explained. “I think that the way that the entire engineering team has faced the new design, the new project, and the 2022 regulations, which were a big discontinuity, was certainly with a more open mind than before.

“I can myself measure it by looking at the car itself, the way it's progressing, and certainly with the amount of innovation we put in it.”

Asked by Motorsport.com to be more specific about the kind of innovation that could be expected, Binotto said that the focuses were on the internal combustion engine, plus less visible components of the chassis.

“On the power unit, it is significantly different to the current one except the hybrid,” he said. “For the hybrid, we introduced it in 2021, as we anticipated what would have been the 2022 rules.

“There will be some changes to the hybrid system for 2022, first for regulations, because more sensors are required from the FIA in all the systems for better policing. But the overall system is very similar to the one we've got and the one we raced at the end of the season.

“But the rest, especially on the internal combustion engine, I have to say is significantly different. We've got a new fuel, which is the 10 percent ethanol, which somehow changed a lot the combustion. We are all losing more or less 20 horsepower, which means somehow that the combustion itself is quite changed. So there were a lot of opportunities in development on the power unit and we changed it quite a lot.”

Talking about the chassis, Binotto added: “I think that the way we approached the exercise was really open minded. And when looking at the car concept, what was possible or not, it is not only the external shapes but whatever you could have done under the bodywork, in terms of layout, in terms of suspension design in terms of full architecture, including as well the powerunit and its architecture.

“I think that the team made significant innovations and the overall design that we are now finalising is quite different to the 2021 project.”

Sainz joined  for 2021 and linked up with Leclerc to help the team take third place in the constructors’ standings as it bounced back from its worst season in 40 years.

Sainz ended the year fifth in the drivers’ championship, 5.5 points ahead of Leclerc, and scored four podiums across the course of the season. Leclerc only finished on the podium once, but picked up two pole positions.

Both Sainz and Leclerc felt the had learned a lot from each other in their first year as teammates, but Sainz revealed he initially found it hard to believe how Leclerc was driving so quickly during pre-season testing.

“Since the moment I arrived to winter testing in Bahrain, I had a lot of things to learn from Charles,” Sainz said. “The way that he was driving the Ferrari in a particular way to be as quick and as fast as he’s being all year long, I’ve had to adapt myself [to it], I had to copy a lot of the stuff that I was seeing on the data.

“Sometimes it was difficult to believe that it was possible to do that, and it was so crazy quick that it was actually a bit shocking. But little by little, adapting and trying to learn from him, I managed to get to a good level.

“There’s still things that when we will go into the winter break, he’s much stronger than me in certain areas. We will exchange some information and we will try and both become better drivers learning from each other.”

Leclerc and Sainz forged a close friendship off-track as well as on-track, coming as a boost to Ferrari as its on-track fortunes enjoyed an upward swing.

“We learned a lot,” Leclerc said. “As always, when you have a new teammate, you always learn, [such as] the new ways Carlos is approaching race weekends, the way he works, his talent, his raw speed also, the way he takes the corners.

“He’s had an amazing year, so he has obviously pushed me very, very much to try and perform better at every race and it’s just been extremely interesting.

“I think maybe one of the strong points of Carlos is the race management and tyre management, and that’s probably been my weakness in 2019. I’ve progressed a lot as a driver in 2020, and again this year, and part of this year is thanks to Carlos.”

Sainz and Leclerc finished one place apart in the race classification for four of the last five rounds of the 2021 season, and enjoyed a close battle for seventh place in Saudi Arabia.

Sainz felt confident that the close competition between him and Leclerc would take both drivers “to a better level next season, and it’s also going to benefit Ferrari.”

“It’s a great competition to have, and a great teammate to have, apart from being a super cool guy to have as a teammate,” said Sainz.

Ahead of Sunday's race, Leclerc lies in fifth place on 158 points, ahead of Lando Norris on 154 and Sainz on 149.5.

Norris gave himself a good shot at jumping Leclerc by qualifying third at Yas Marina, while Sainz will start fifth, and Leclerc seventh.

Although he has a two-place advantage on his teammate, Sainz insists that he's not concerned about his personal position, and is instead focussed on Ferrari's slim chance of overhauling McLaren for third place in the constructors' championship.

"I need something weird to happen, which I don't want, because I don't want any chance of McLaren getting ahead in the constructors'," he said.

"I just want to finish the season on a high.

"Today the homework is done with a strong qualy, and tomorrow with a strong race I will go to the winter break very happy independent of where I finish in the championship, because to be in the fight for P5 already with Lando and Charles, that is their third year with the car, and actually having a chance of beating them, already means it's a positive year.

"And I just need to focus and get in a good season finally to go into the winter break confident. And already today definitely helps."

Sainz felt that Abu Dhabi qualifying was further evidence of the step that he's made recently.

"Particularly the last six or seven races I feel like I got the best out of the car in pretty much every qualy, and this is something that I managed to do at McLaren very often. And it was a bit of a lesson to be pushed in this last third of this season.

"To be honest, I have been up against strong qualifiers my whole career, with Max [Verstappen], Lando and Charles now, and I've never felt like I have anything to lose against them.

"I just think this last third I'm doing what I was doing in the McLaren and in the Toro Rosso when I was on top of it."

He was relieved to find performance when it mattered after a disappointing first day in Abu Dhabi.

"I was not at home for the first time in six or seven races on a Friday. I was really a bit lost and we couldn't understand why.

"Today we turned things around and I found a much easier car to drive and I could adapt myself so thanks to the team on that regard. It was quite a challenging qualy, still but we managed to put it together.

"How you treat the tyre was quite important, not only change the floor and the gearbox, put the race gearbox on definitely gave us back some performance.

"But the tyre was a big thing. In Q2 I was really pushing in Sector 1 and 2 and then in Sector 3 always struggling, and for Q3 I managed to change a bit my approach and put a very solid Sector 3 and go down into the 1m22s, that was the target for Q3."

Leclerc lost the rear and hit the wall hard in the closing stages of Friday's second practice, leaving  with an extensive overnight repair job.

Remarkably, both the chassis and power unit were salvaged after the heavy impact, and Leclerc repaid his promise to thank his mechanics in “the best way possible”.

The 24-year-old survived another hairy moment at Turn 22 on his final Q3 lap to gain 0.2 seconds and split the Red Bulls.

“I don't think we could have expected anything more than that,” Leclerc said.

“The lap was really, really good was really, really on the limit. Turn 22 I kind of closed the eyes on my fast lap, and it worked out!

“It was a very, very good lap, and I'm very happy to be starting P4 tomorrow.

“Eyes closed is just an expression, I'm pretty sure I had my eyes open! But yeah, I lost the rear, and I honestly thought that the end will have been the same as yesterday.

“But this time I kept it on track, and made it stick. So I was very happy.”

Leclerc, who took pole for the Monaco and Baku street circuit races earlier in the season, admitted that building up his confidence was key to his qualifying performance.

“The confidence in the streets circuits is what makes the most difference at the end,” he said.

“And overall, every time we managed to give me a car that gives me the confidence, which was very, very difficult here, especially with what happened yesterday.

“I just had to do step by step from the first laps of FP3 to the last lap in Q3. And in the last lap of Q3 I could finally put everything together and just go for it. And it worked out.

“If you look at Turn 22, I think all day I haven't been very confident with what happened yesterday, and just in the last lap of Q3 I gained something like two-tenths against all of my other laps before. So I just went for it.”

Leclerc admitted that like teammate Carlos Sainz Jr he struggled on the medium tyres in Q2, although his struggles weren't as considerable as the Spaniard, who was knocked out in 15th place after a lurid Turn 11 spin.

“I also had a very difficult Q2,” Leclerc explained.

“I think Q1, [Sainz] was probably more at ease with the car. And I also was, and then once we went on the medium, the car was just extremely tricky to drive, the rear was very, very difficult.

“But at the end, we managed to change a little bit the car on the second run of Q2, and it was a little bit better, and then I put it all together in Q3 with a soft.”

Leclerc admitted he didn’t feel 100 percent fit on Saturday morning, suffering from sore feet and an aching head, but was more surprised that the car could be repaired after an impact that “felt very, very bad”.

“I hit the rear first and the rear took all the shock, so if anything it's quite crazy the engine has nothing.

“The chassis then hit later on, but it was less of a shock for it. But yeah, it was quite quite a big one.”

The Red Bull driver went off track while defending his lead from championship rival Hamilton at Turn 4 of the Interlagos circuit, an incident for which  requested the right to review after it wasn't investigated by the stewards during the race.

Hamilton said after the meeting with Masi that the racing rules remained unclear and that "every driver, I think, expect for Max, was asking about just for clarity".

Masi said in Qatar that the rules had been "made clear" to the drivers, although he admitted some disagreed with them.

driver Sainz joined the group of drivers who believe the rules are still somewhat confusing, but reckons there will be further discussions after the season in order to make things better.

"In terms of racing approach it's not very clear still," said Sainz after the Qatar GP. "I think you've heard us already talk about this because we don't know exactly what is going to happen race by race.

"But as I said to the media after yesterday, it looks like in the winter there's going to be a deeper conversation about the way that we go racing that hopefully should clarify things a bit more."

driver  said that while some aspects of the racing rules have been clarified, others still remain vague.

"I think some things are a bit more clear, some things not," he said. "I think what is clear is that... not every incident will be the same, even if it looks identical so it's hard to know what the different circumstances are.

"But I think most things were cleared up. But it's hard to kind of ever give a definite point and say this is what you can and can't do."

When asked if he will change his approach in on-track battles after the meeting, Norris said: "I mean, no. A little bit. There's a couple of things maybe you would adjust.

"I don't think you would change the way or we would change the way we race or anything, but yeah you would maybe just adjust a couple of things you could possibly now do, or not do. I don't think you'd change much."

, one of the drivers who has been critical about the inconsistent of the stewards this year, said F1 needs the rules to be "black and white".

"I think we are all agreed on that, we need more consistency, we need black and white rules, because when they are grey," he said.

"Sometimes you feel you are benefitting from them, and sometimes you've been the bad or the idiot on track again. It's better when it's black and white.

"Let's see if we can improve altogether. I think it's not only an FIA issue, it's drivers, teams, FIA, all we need to work together to have a better rule."

DATE: 2021

The Maranello outfit has been embroiled in a season-long battle for third with , but has pulled ahead of its British rival in the latter part of the campaign, especially thanks to the results in the last three races.

is 39.5 points ahead of McLaren with just two races remaining after the Woking team managed to score just four points in the latest triple-header in Mexico, Brazil and Qatar.

But despite the progress made by Ferrari - which finished sixth in the standings last year with less than half the points it has scored in 2021 - Binotto insists the focus has been on developing its 2022 car for the introduction of new regulations.

"We never really developed the current car," said Binotto. "We introduced a couple of developments at the very start of the season and that's it.

"Except for the power unit later on but the power unit, again that was a development in view of 2022, so all our efforts from the very start of the season has always been the 2022 car, we never compromised it.

"So let's say that it never came into our mind even to at some stage try to penalise 2022 at the benefit of 2021.

"We knew that we could have fight for the third place at the start of this season, we knew it could have been very tight but we knew that our main objective in 2021 was not third place but to try to improve in all the details as a team and third place has simply been an output of it.

"I think if today we are reaching third place it's because the team, the way they are working at various weekends has certainly improved a lot since the start of the season and not because the car itself has developed," he added.

Binotto reckons that several factors outside of car and engine development have contributed to Ferrari taking a leap forward this season.

"I think the race team since the start of the season has made a lot of progress," he said.

"It has made a lot of progress in terms of strategy, the way we manage, the communication with the drivers, the understanding of what we are doing. It has improved a lot in terms of tyre management.

"I think that the team since Paul Ricard developed a lot of small tools, methodologies to try to do it better.

He added: "If I look at where we were last year, sixth, with little points in the championship, I think we made the most of we could do with the current regulations and most of the car had also very limited opportunities of development as well about the car in 2021.

"So overall, I think that the team has made great progress with what was possible to do, and for that I am so happy because yes, the third position is a great output of the efforts."

DATE: 2021

Leclerc dropped out in Q2 at the Losail International Circuit on Saturday evening, finishing nine tenths of a second off pace-setter  time and over three tenths behind  teammate

Leclerc sat last in the order after his first run in Q2, but told Ferrari over the radio that he had "no idea" where the time was being lost as he felt his car was "quite on the limit".

Speaking to the written media in Qatar after qualifying, Leclerc conceded that he had "no idea" what happened in qualifying as he struggled for grip.

"Normally I'm quite good at understanding what's wrong, in a qualifying lap especially, which is one of my strengths," Leclerc said.

"But this one is a very strange one. I just had no grip from all four tyres. It's not like I had a balance issue or anything like that. I was just struggling with all four tyres with grip.

"So we need to look into it whether there was anything strange or not. If there's not anything strange, then I will be very happy to understand what I did wrong. Let's see."

Leclerc said he did not feel any of the issues during final practice earlier in the day, but was losing "around five or six tenths" in the first sector through qualifying.

"I have no idea why," Leclerc said. "The tyres just felt at their limits. I don't know if I wasn't putting the car, the tyres in the right window before the lap. I have no idea for now, but we need to find an explanation."

Leclerc added that his fastest lap in Q2 felt clean, making him question if there was something that had gone wrong during the session to explain his lack of pace.

"I was very confused when I heard the one second over the radio," Leclerc said.

"I think I'm pretty sure there's something that went wrong this qualifying - well obviously, I'm a second off on the first run of Q2 - but something standing out and something quite big, because I just cannot explain it."

Asked what his expectations were for the race given the difficulty of following other cars in Qatar, Leclerc replied: "I think anything is possible. We will have a free choice of tyres, so hopefully we can take advantage of it."

DATE: 2021

and Carlos Sainz finished fifth and sixth respectively on Sunday in Mexico, lifting  above  into third place in the constructors' championship by 13.5 points.

Ferrari had trailed in the fight since McLaren's 1-2 finish at Monza in September, but outscored its rival at each of the last three races to turn the battle around.

However, team principal Binotto admitted after the race that Ferrari had expected to perform better in Mexico, having failed to challenge either Red Bull or , as well as losing out to   in the fight for fourth.

"We were hoping for a better weekend in terms of performance, but overall I think as a team result, it has been a great team result today," Binotto said after the race in Mexico.

"The two drivers collaborated well. In terms of team strategy, we tried whatever we could to catch Gasly, but we couldn't.

"In terms of points and championship, we are in third position now, 13.5 points ahead of McLaren, four races to go. So I think it's still a very tight battle.

"Certainly McLaren struggled as well the last weekend. Let's see now in Brazil in a week's time. Hopefully we may consolidate what we have seen today."

The high-altitude conditions in Mexico meant teams had to run their high downforce aerodynamic packages, an area in which Ferrari has excelled so far this season, scoring pole in Monaco.

But Binotto felt the gap to Red Bull and Mercedes had in fact grown over the weekend compared to recent races.

"If I look at the last races, I think we had a pace which was a lot closer to the top teams," Binotto said.

"For a while today, it was nine-tenths of a second. So I think in terms of the relative gap to the top cars, today we are a bit behind.

"Honestly I was hoping coming to Mexico, where we know somehow as well the power unit counts less, because it's a circuit that is less power sensitive, to have a better overall relative performance, which has not been the case.

"We struggled a bit on performance in qualy, we struggled a bit as well today compared to the best cars. And I think the fact that Gasly has been ahead of us is another sign.

"Certainly he did very well, so well done to Gasly and AlphaTauri. But I think that today we could have finished, or at least I was hoping to finish ahead of the AlphaTauri and closer to the best."

Leclerc and Sainz were surprised to see Gasly and AlphaTauri perform so strongly, having failed to keep up with the Frenchman despite attempts to split strategies and use team orders.

"In qualifying and in the race, actually AlphaTauri I think has been better than what we expected them to be," Leclerc said.

"Compared to the others in the race I will say the hard stint has been has been more difficult than what we expected it to be too. But otherwise it was all the rest was in line with what we expected."

Sainz added: "On Thursday I wanted to be clear that since Monaco, a lot of things have changed, particularly the top teams have developed a lot the car.

"You can see how Mercedes and Red Bull, they have a bigger gap now than what they had at the beginning of the season in a lot of tracks to us.

"The biggest surprise was probably AlphaTauri, that they were as quick as us, maybe a tenth quicker the the whole weekend. They had a bit the edge.

"But in terms of our performance to the leaders, they had more or less the gap they had in the last few races, and this track just exposed where we are lacking a bit.

"But in general, a positive weekend."

DATE: 2021

The Monegasque and his team-mate were locked in a tight fight with ’s  throughout the Mexico City race as they battled for fourth spot.

A strategy offset between the two  drivers, with Sainz having extended his opening stint to have fresher hards at the end, had brought him on to the back of Leclerc and with a shot of going after Gasly.

Ferrari issued a radio instruction to Leclerc to let Sainz through, but did not appear to get an immediate response from him.

Shortly after, Sainz suggested that Leclerc was pushing hard, and locking up, simply to stay ahead.

However, Leclerc did eventually give way to see what Sainz could do – but with the Spaniard failing in his quest to overhaul the AlphaTauri ahead, he eventually gave back the position before the chequered flag.

While Leclerc's delay in letting Sainz through suggested he was not too happy about the situation, he actually says that giving up the place was far from simple because of the influence of backmarkers.

“I was okay with it,” explained Leclerc about the team orders call. “Basically, I had a very tough time with the hard tyres in the first laps with the things I was complaining on the radio.

“As soon as I was asked to let him by, I had the blue flag so I had to go through [George] Russell and [Lance] Stroll, so the two cars that had blue flags in front of me.

“We waited one lap and actually on that lap the fronts cleared, and I gained one second in one lap.

“Then the team told me: standby don't give the position back. Then two laps later they asked me to give it back, and I gave it.”

Sainz thinks that the delay in Leclerc letting him through did cost some time.

Asked if he felt that could have made the difference in his fight with Gasly, Sainz said: “It's a tricky question.

“Right when I caught Charles he was also lapping a  and an Aston, so the situation gets a bit trickier and a bit messy.

“Obviously he's being told to let me by but, at the same time, he's trying to clear the blue flags.

“I'm not going to lie, I lost two or three seconds of race time there that, as a team, we need to see how we can maybe improve it the next time.

“But it is very tricky. I mean, position swaps are probably the most tricky bit in F1 and this time we got it fairly right.

“So yes, I lost a bit of time there but we will try to see what we could have done different and learn for the next one.”

But despite the potential for the swap having been done earlier, Sainz said the afternoon was a valuable lesson for everyone at Ferrari on team work.

“What is important is that we get confident as a team to do it and respect the team orders,” he added.

“It will happen later this season or in the following years to come that that we might be in a similar situation. So as teammates and as a whole team, we need to get comfortable at the switching positions at some tracks, like we've done in other races. I think as a team, we executed it nicely.”

Leclerc entered the race weekend at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez feeling optimistic given ’s strength at high downforce tracks this year and the set-up requirements of the circuit.

While Ferrari ended Friday in Mexico as the leading midfield team, it finished over a second off ’s P1 time for Red Bull, led by Carlos Sainz Jr in fifth with Leclerc three-tenths further back in seventh.

Towards the end of second practice, Leclerc told Ferrari over team radio that he was “struggling so much with the engine issues”.

Leclerc explained after practice that the problems were nothing major to worry about, and that the team understood what was happening.

“We had some things going on in the background that wasn’t pleasant to drive, but nothing too big,” Leclerc said.

“Everything we can control, so it’s no big problems, it’s just a bit more difficult to drive in those conditions.”

Leclerc added that the issue was “just a bit of a lack of torque sometimes out of the corners” and a “lack of acceleration, but nothing too big”.

The high altitude and reduced air density in Mexico City means greater strain is placed on the power units at times, often levelling performance gaps between different engine suppliers.

Sainz thought that teams were “all suffering a bit here and there with the temperatures, because of the thin air here and everything”, making it “quite a challenging day” for him.

Ferrari is looking to leapfrog  in the fight for third place in the constructors’ championship this weekend after moving to within 3.5 points of the British team last time out in Austin. Sainz and Leclerc both noted the impressive Friday display by , who finished sixth with  and had  also reach the top 10 in FP2.

“It’s strange because we came here thinking that we would be quite competitive, but actually AlphaTauri looks very competitive,” Leclerc said.

“The Honda guys in general look very competitive. And McLaren also will be there. So it’s going to be very, very tight [in qualifying].”

Sainz added: “We’ve been looking good in the last few races. But here, I don’t feel like we have nailed the car balance yet.

“We are still a bit far from ideal car balance and ideal feeling with the car, and what we’re trying to do now going into tomorrow is make sure we put it in the right window and gain those extra couple of tenths that can put us in front of the AlphaTauri.

“At the moment, they look a bit quicker.”

The Maranello-based team is just three-and-a-half points behind  in the battle for third sport behind  and Red Bull with five races to go.

And, with a recent engine upgrade having lifted its performance, the team is increasingly bullish about its prospects for the remainder of the campaign.

At the United States Grand Prix,  finished a strong fourth, almost 25 seconds clear of the lead McLaren of .

That performance was especially important because the Austin layout, with its high-speed corners and long straights, is not one that should have especially favoured the Italian squad.

And it is why  team boss Mattia Binotto thinks that the unique nature of Mexico, where teams run with maximum wing, could be an even better hunting ground.

"In Mexico, we are running there with maximum downforce performance, and it is a track where power sensitivity is less important," he said.

"So although there is still a gap to Mercedes [in power terms], I think the Mexico track will be in our favour compared to what we saw in Austin."

Binotto reckoned that the fact that Ferrari was faster than McLaren in Austin was significant, because it was a venue that should have played to the strengths of McLaren.

"Generally speaking, this year the McLaren has been always very competitive with the medium/high speed corners, and again it was the case in Austin," he said.

"But I think if I look at the overall performance of the weekend, we were ahead of them: which was very obvious in qualifying, and Charles [in the race] was half a second on average ahead of Ricciardo, finishing 25 seconds ahead of him.

"In the overall balance of the lap. I think we have been clearly faster and, I think on paper, it was not a circuit which was suiting obviously our car.

"That's why I'm pleased with the progress I've seen in the last races, and certainly the help of the power unit, both for quali and the race. That gives me some confidence for the next races."

While Gasly could not emulate his shock win at Monza from 2020, the Frenchman picked up a podium finish in Azerbaijan, and was outside of the top 10 in just three races where he saw the chequered flag.

narrowly lost out to  in the fight for fifth place in the constructors’ championship, finishing 13 points behind.

Gasly said that while it was “difficult” to see such a small gap separating the teams at the end of a long season, he took heart from how AlphaTauri had performed throughout the campaign.

“What we have achieved as a team, when we look at all the previous years of AlphaTauri and Toro Rosso, is incredible,” Gasly said.

“So [I’m] really proud of these guys, and also hopeful for the next year and what we can achieve. Because they have proved this year that they can perform at very high levels.”

While Gasly did not think 2021 surpassed 2020 as his best season in F1, saying that “nothing can beat this winning feeling”, the chance to regularly battle with midfield leaders  and  had kept him motivated.

"As an entire season, 22 races, I must say I enjoyed all 22,” Gasly said.

“Coming into a race weekend knowing you're going to be fighting for points, you're going to fight with Ferraris and McLarens, is just a different kind of excitement.

“I must say I've loved it all year, and I really hope it's going to be the case [again] next year.”

Alpine managed to pull clear of AlphaTauri in the fight for fifth late in the year, boosted by ’s podium finish and ’s run to fifth in Qatar. Ocon also scored a shock win for the team in Hungary, helping it take P5.

Gasly joked that it was “a shame we don't take off the best and the worst result of the year”, but praised Alpine for doing “a good job”.

“I do believe we did very well and we could have finished fifth, but that didn't happen,” Gasly said.

“I'm still very proud of what we have achieved and what I've achieved. You know, 110 points, it doesn't happen very often with Alpha Tauri. I’ve enjoyed this season a lot.

“I know next year could be very different. It could be same, could be better, could be worse. But at the end of the day, I’m just happy to have seen the team performing in that way, because it gives hope for next year.”

While  and Red Bull comfortably finished first and second in this year’s standings,  and  both made considerable steps forward to cut the gap to the front of the field.

McLaren scored a 1-2 finish at Monza, while Ferrari picked up five podiums and two poles across the year as the fight for third in the constructors’ went to the final race of the season.

A strong end to the year ultimately gave Ferrari P3 by 47.5 points in the final standings, but both teams felt the fight had helped sharpen them for potential future battle further up the grid.

“I would say it has helped quite a bit,” said McLaren driver Norris when asked by Motorsport.com about the benefits of the battle against Ferrari.

“Just being with that mentality, them keeping us on our toes, keeping us pushing, trying to find these smallest bits of lap time.

“It is easy at times to get complacent and take your mind off of it, especially if you are on your own, the third-quickest car with nobody ahead or behind you.

“There are ways to fall into that trap, so I think it has been good for us. The same for them - not an easy year for them, so I think it has benefitted both of us.”

Norris said he believed McLaren had enjoyed a “much better season” despite slipping from third to fourth in the teams’ standings. McLaren scored 275 points this season, compared to 202 in 2020.

“I would say it has been a tough season and I still believe we’ve had a much better season than we did last year,” said Norris.

“We are closer to the front, and the gap to the rest is also much bigger, apart from Ferrari. It has still been a very good season, and not just in terms of results and points, but also how we worked together as a team and how we maximised things.

“I think we are in a better position for next year when we are going to racing them more often and hopefully the guys at the front more often too.”

Both McLaren and Ferrari are hoping to take advantage of the incoming overhaul of the technical regulations in 2022 to take another step forward that would allow them to challenge the front-running teams.

Ferrari sporting director Laurent Mekies agreed that the fight with McLaren had helped the team work on its operations and race executions, calling it “our world championship for this year”.

“We really focused on how we can use this year to become sharper and to develop as a race team and to develop our tools and so on,” Mekies said.

“It’s a very good team to fight against. They’ve had some fantastic moments, they won Monza, they could have won Sochi. They are very, very competitive. They are also in a very good dynamic themselves.

“So it was a good challenge. And yes, it’s a challenge where you need to make fewer mistakes than them. You need to put more of these small details together if you want to beat them.

“It is ultimately the same thing that is happening for the top two positions. It’s the same dynamic. The points loss costs you the same, and therefore, it was a good, it is a good training for that for the team.”

Sainz managed to outscore  in their first year as team-mates, helping Ferrari to secure third place in the constructors’ championship ahead of his former team, .

The Spaniard capped off his season with a third place finish in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. He said after the race that he “couldn’t ask for more” to round out his first year with Ferrari.

Ferrari team principal Binotto was jokingly asked after the race if now was the best time to renew Sainz’s contract, despite it having a year still to run. But he said they would chat about future plans over the winter when reviewing his season.

“I think Carlos did a great year,” Binotto said.

“When we signed a year ago, we said that winter time, so this is winter time, [is] the right moment to sit down and have a review of the season. That is something we will certainly do during the winter.

“There will be certainly a review altogether, and of the season itself, and we’ll start discussing what can be our future.”

Carlos Sainz Jr., Ferrari

Binotto felt impressed by how Sainz had performed considering it was his first season with Ferrari, and repeated his belief that he formed the best line-up on the F1 grid alongside Leclerc.

“When we signed with Carlos, the objective was to have two good drivers that were good racers, consistent and capable of scoring points for the team,” Binotto said.

“I think it’s what we got this season. So I’m very proud of both of them. I think as I often said, we’ve got the best line-up in Formula 1, and I’m pretty happy with what Carlos did this season.

“Being his very first season with Ferrari, it was not straightforward and obvious. We signed with him because we said he is a good racer, consistent, always scoring good points. But I think he’s as well a good learner.

“During the season, he has improved, and I think that the end of the season is his best part of the entire season.”

Sainz finished third at the Yas Marina Circuit on Sunday after a frenetic finish that saw  retire for Red Bull and  put the  driver under late pressure, finishing just half a second behind at the chequered flag.

The result secured fifth place for Sainz in the drivers’ championship to end his first season with Ferrari, leapfrogging ’s  and Ferrari team-mate  in the standings.

It capped off Sainz’s best season in F1 to date, eclipsing his previous-best points total from 2020 and including four podium finishes.

“I couldn’t have asked for more to be honest, especially the podium,” Sainz said following Sunday’s race in Abu Dhabi.

“The whole race today was just a matter of putting everything together, everything I’ve learned through the year, the way that I’ve progressed with a team in executing a good race.

“Today finally I felt like I put everything together to have a very strong race. At the end, I had the positive consequences in all the outcomes, but [I’m] more proud of the race than anything else really.”

Sainz ended the year 5.5 points clear of Leclerc, with whom he enjoyed a close fight throughout the 2021 season in their first year as Ferrari teammates.

“I got basically surprised,” Leclerc explained.

“I don’t know whether it was the dirty air of Max. Max was a little bit on the left so I don’t know what happened there, but I was very surprised and got a snap and was very lucky to actually not to lose it completely.

“I managed to catch it back and then basically the rears were just over, so I started to struggle with the tyres and we had to stop a few laps after.

“With Yuki everything was good, it was a nice battle. It didn’t last too long but it was a nice battle.”

DATE: 2021

Earlier this week, Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported that , a position similar to the role the late Niki Lauda had at  in recent years.

The report said Todt, who has been FIA president since 2009, had already held discussions with  chairman John Elkann about a possible return.

However, Binotto insisted the rumours were just that, and denied there had been any talks with Todt.

Binotto did admit, however, that he would be honoured to work with Todt again in the future.

"I heard and I read about some speculation in that respect, but I can say that so far they are only speculations," said Binotto in Friday's press conference in Abu Dhabi.

"Personally I have worked with Jean Todt, he has been my boss, I think I learned a lot from him.

"It has been an honour to work with him and whatever would be the future it would still be an honour for me to work together with him, because I still believe that as a team there's still much to learn."

Asked if Ferrari had been in talks with Todt about a possible role at the team in the future, Binotto simply said: "No".

Todt, 75, is on his last term as FIA president, with an election to choose a successor to take place next week.

The Frenchman joined Ferrari as the team's general manager in 1993 and, under his leadership, the Italian squad won 14 Formula 1 world championships in what was one of the Scuderia's most successful eras in the sport.

He was Ferrari's team boss when  won five of his seven titles, helping the German take 72 of his 91 grands prix wins.

In 2004 he was also appointed Ferrari CEO before he moved to an advisor role at the end of the 2006 season.

Todt remained on the Ferrari board until early 2009 before he was elected FIA president later that year.

The  Drivers’ Academy member, who is currently second in the FIA Formula 2 drivers’ standings, will drive the SF21, splitting driving duties with the team’s specialist simulator driver, .

Shwartzman has already driven a Ferrari F1 car twice in 2021, but in both cases – in January at Fiorano and in September at Imola – it was the 2018 car. He also drove the SF1000 at last year’s end of season Abu Dhabi test.

Shwartzman said: “I am extremely happy to do another test with Scuderia Ferrari.

“It’s an honour to be able to drive this F1 car but also a big responsibility and I am therefore extremely grateful for the trust Ferrari has put in me. I will certainly try to enjoy it as much as possible while aiming to do a good job of acquiring data for the team.”

It was confirmed last month that .

Robert Shwartzman, Ferrari SF71H

The 2019 FIA Formula 3 champion has won two races and taken seven podiums this year, and sits behind teammate Oscar Piastri, ’s 2022 reserve driver, in the standings.

He finished second in Sunday’s feature race in Jeddah, which was shortened to 20 minutes after the original race was red-flagged following a frightening startline shunt, where the stalled Theo Pourchaire was collected by the unsighted Enzo Fittipaldi.

Haas team principal Gunther Steiner previously praised Shwartzman’s ability, saying: “We’re looking forward to testing with Robert at Yas Marina in December. He’s obviously highly rated by Ferrari – having been part of their driver program since the end of 2017.

“His ability is clearly in evidence when you look at his performances over the last few seasons – most notably his rookie campaign in Formula 2 last year – competing against the likes of our own two drivers  and . We are pleased to be able to give Robert an outing in a Formula 1 car and we look forward to working with him in Abu Dhabi.”

DATE: 2021

But after a career that has included success in rallying, sportscars and F1, plus three-terms at the helm of motor racing’s governing body, it was unlikely he would simply walk away from the sport.

A report in Corriere della Sera on Wednesday pointed, however, to one potential avenue that could be Todt’s focus over the next few years: a sensational return to  in a super consultant type role once his FIA successor is declared on December 17.

The story suggests that Todt has been in constant contact with Ferrari president John Elkann about the idea of taking up some advisory role at his former team.

It may not be a coincidence that Todt was in Maranello a few days ago to support the second edition of the ‘Girls on Track - Rising Stars’ initiative promoted by the FIA.

Any potential role for Todt at Ferrari would reconnect the team to its winning past, with the Frenchman having delivered a total of 14 drivers’ and constructors’ titles during a tenure as team principal and then CEO at the squad from 1993 to 2009.

It is suggested that Todt could take on a role that would allow Elkann to delegate certain political functions in the management of the Scuderia, such as the discussion of the 2026 regulations, without taking away any of the responsibilities of team boss Mattia Binotto.

In fact, it could serve to help Binotto in being able to focus on more immediate performance as the Scuderia bids to get back to winning ways in 2022.

It was notable that Elkann did not consider Todt for the Ferrari CEO role after Louis Camilleri's departure last year, perhaps feeling that a 75-year-old figure was not the right one to lead the future of the brand in a delicate phase amid the automotive shift to electric power.

However, the potential role for Todt now would be different, with a more external but politically relevant role in the Maranello organisation chart, in a period when getting the right outcome to the framing of the 2026 engine rules will be critical.

Those in favour of Todt's return to Maranello recognise that the Frenchman has great political power in the world of motorsport, and he has extensive knowledge of how the sport works.

Let's not forget the friendship that binds him to Stefano Domenicali, the current F1 CEO who replaced him as Ferrari team principal. Furthermore, Todt’s son Nicolas is the manager of .

Some compare Todt's possible role in Ferrari to that which the late Niki Lauda went through twice in his career – once at Maranello and once at .

The first spell was as Luca di Montezemolo's right-hand man in the restructuring of Ferrari in the early 1990s. This was when Todt’s own cycle in command began in 1993. At that time, Lauda had no operational role and the initiative proved to be a failure.

But Lauda’s later experience at Mercedes was different. He was appointed as non-executive chairman of the F1 team and was a brilliant right-hand man to Toto Wolff – and his commitment was ensured as he took a shareholding in the squad.

But could Todt bring enough to Ferrari to justify an involvement? Those who shake their heads at the idea suggest it makes no sense to recall a former team boss from an era that the squad has moved on from.

Ultimately, though, bringing Todt back to Ferrari is a decision only Elkann will know makes sense or not.

DATE: 2021

Leclerc lost the rear of his car at Turn 22 towards the end of second practice for the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix,

The session was immediately red flagged, but Leclerc was able to get out of the car unassisted and told his Ferrari team that he was OK. He underwent routine medical checks before being given the all clear by the doctors.

Ferrari said after the session that it would review Leclerc’s chassis and power unit to see if they could be repaired in time for Saturday, later confirming both could still be run in FP3 and qualifying.

But the crash nevertheless left the Ferrari crew facing a big workload ahead of Saturday’s running to get Leclerc’s car repaired.

Leclerc finished FP2 10th-fastest despite his late crash, ending the session seven-tenths of a second behind pace-setter Lewis Hamilton.

“[It was] a day that unfortunately didn’t end up the way I wanted,” Leclerc said.

“But overall, we went through everything we wanted to test. I think the potential is here, and if we put everything together for tomorrow, we should have a good day.

“But obviously I’m sorry for the team who will have to do a big, big work ahead of tomorrow for the car to be ready.

“Hopefully I’ll do a good enough job to thank them in the best way possible with a good result tomorrow.”

Ferrari heads into this weekend’s Saudi Arabian Grand Prix with the chance to clinch third place in the constructors’ championship ahead of McLaren with one race to spare.

The Italian team sits 39.5 points clear of McLaren in the standings, meaning a five-point swing this weekend would give it an unassailable advantage before the Abu Dhabi season finale.

“We don’t want to relax,” Leclerc told Motorsport.com on Thursday in Jeddah.

“With these last two races, I think there’s still plenty to learn as a team to try and optimise all of my package better.

“This will help us indirectly for next year, so we need to keep pushing.”

DATE: 2021

The 1999 CART champion and 2000 Indy 500 winner, Montoya was a sensation when he moved from the States to Formula 1 in 2001, partnering Ralf Schumacher at Williams.

With a competitive FW23 and powerful BMW engine Montoya was one of the few drivers who could challenge the great Michael Schumacher in his dominant Ferrari years, first making the German aware of his arrival with .

Notoriously plagued by reliability issues, Williams was no factor in the championship that year, but Montoya did manage to take three poles and score his maiden win on Ferrari's home turf at Monza – which he famously went on to lap at 162.9mph in 2004 qualifying.

Montoya ended up taking seven wins during campaigns at Williams and McLaren before leaving part-way through the 2006 season, returning to the US for stints in NASCAR and IndyCar, which yielded another Indy 500 win.

At last weekend's Ferrari Finali Mondiali event, an annual celebration of the brand at Mugello, Montoya finally managed to get behind the wheel of the team he competed against so ferociously across six F1 seasons.

Montoya got behind the wheel of a 2008-spec Ferrari F2008 car owned by his DragonSpeed WEC teammate Henrik Hedman. The Colombian was still grinning ear to ear when quizzed about his experience by Motorsport.com's Italian edition.

"My teammate this year, Henrik Hedman, invited us to drive the car and it's been really cool. It's been an amazing experience," he said.

"You know, it's a car we always competed against in F1. And it's strange to be able to come here and drive an F1 car in Mugello. I mean, it doesn't get a lot better than this."

Juan Pablo Montoya, Ferrari F2008

With his speed and unflappable attitude towards Schumacher and Ferrari, Montoya quickly became a fan favourite around the world - and a nemesis for the tifosi. But Montoya believes his Latin flair and aggression was also appreciated by the Italian fans, even if they couldn't root for him on a race weekend.

Asked what his experience was like to be public enemy number one when he won the 2001 Italian Grand Prix, Montoya suggested there were a lot of "mixed feelings" among Ferrari fans seeing him beat the Scuderia.

"You had to beat them every week, You know what I mean?," he said. "Especially if you came to Italy, the place you always want to beat them [at] and we were always very good at Monza, so it was always very special.

"It was interesting because by being Colombian and the Latino thing, I think a lot of Italians really liked me. So, I think it was a lot of mixed feelings.

"But Ferrari always has so much tradition and everything, and to be able to after all these years actually get in one and do some laps was really nice."

Asked about his experience of sampling the Ferrari F2008, which famously almost propelled Felipe Massa to the world championship until an unforgettable title showdown in Brazil, Montoya admitted he had to resist the urge to take such a legendary, invaluable chassis to the limit.

"Every car is very different," he said when asked how the Ferrari compared to his cars at Williams and McLaren.

"I never thought when I left Williams that I was going to get into a McLaren and it should drive very similar, and it wasn't. It was a big shock at the beginning.

"Driving this is difficult to know, because the tyres are a lot harder than what we raced, but the feeling of the car is really nice, you can tell how well everything is done in the car.

"It's hard because you want to drive it really hard, but you don't want to make a mistake and damage somebody else's car! If you think about it, that car is the last time Ferrari won a constructors' championship..."

However, on top of that, it also ran an asymmetric layout in terms of its drum design, for the different challenges posed by the Interlagos circuit.

On the right-hand side of the car the team opted for its open basket configuration, with the windows opened above the disc in Mexico (inset) deleted once more.

Meanwhile, on the left-hand side of the car, a closed drum was favoured. This tapers more on the outboard end and features a handful of fins to help control the movement of the airflow as it’s pushed out the wheel rim.

It’s clear to see that both of these brake assemblies offer something a little bit different when it comes to how the airflow passes through them.

The right-hand side option delivers more of an aerodynamic benefit, as the airflow is dumped out of the wheel face.

In contrast, the left-hand side layout focuses more on temperature control, as it forms more of a barrier to the wheel rim, and transfers less heat to the tyre as a consequence.

Red Bull also returned to its more traditional arrangement in Brazil, having used a different configuration in Mexico.

The team had used a shortened bypass panel in Mexico exposing the brake disc, while another panel sat outboard of this to help control the direction of the airflow passing out through the wheel rim.

In Brazil, the full-length bypass panel was employed once more, as a greater emphasis was placed on the aerodynamic benefit it creates since cooling was clearly less of a priority than it was in Mexico.

In both instances, Red Bull treats the bypass panel’s surface with a thermal barrier paint, to help control the transfer of heat from one part of the assembly to another.

DATE: 2021

F1’s bosses are set for talks with teams over the winter to agree on a format for the six sprint events that are planned for 2022.

One of the key considerations being made is how to make the Saturday 100km sprint more exciting, with the day’s action having not quite lived up to expectations so far.

F1 believes that offering more championship points for the sprint race could be one way of delivering an extra edge to proceedings.

However, some teams like  think F1 should be even bolder and make the Saturdays sprint a standalone event – with reverse grids.

While not all teams are in agreement with such a move, Ferrari thinks that the outcome of last weekend’s Brazilian GP is proof that the concept can work.

Thanks to Hamilton's exclusion from qualifying for a DRS rules breach, the world champion had to start at the back of the grid for Saturday’s sprint race.

He managed to charge his way through to finish fifth, and then on Sunday, thanks to a five-place grid penalty for a fresh engine, he came through from 10th to win.

Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto believes that the spectacle of Hamilton’s surge, allied to the fact he went from the back to the front, shows that reverse grids are viable.

Asked by Motorsport.com if he felt the Interlagos evidence strengthened the case for reverse grids, Binotto said: “I think it does honestly, because of so many overtakings, and so much fun.

“I think we should really consider it, and that's obviously for the sprint race format. Having seen what happens, I think it's even not debatable.”

While Ferrari is in favour of the reverse grid concept,  driver  thinks that doing so could serve to devalue the meaning of a race win on an F1 weekend.

“Don't get me wrong, Lewis starting at the back made the race even more exciting for spectators. I’m quite sure of that,” he said.

“So I think the [sprint] race benefited from at least having Lewis in a reverse grid position.

“It couldn't be more exciting, but I still stand by the view that a win should be a win.

“I know it's just a sprint race, so holds less value, but I still feel that to cross the line first, you still should be the best driver, at least in that race itself.

“So if you've only done it because you qualified last but started on pole, I'm not sure. I don't know how much satisfaction you can take from that. So it's probably more just a personal feeling of satisfaction that would maybe make me steer away from that reverse grid idea still.”

DATE: 2021

The Italian outfit has been involved in discussions about a new deal with PMI for several months now, with its current contract coming to a finish at the end of this year.

PMI is one of  longest-serving partners and has most recently utilised its title sponsorship of Ferrari to promote its Mission Winnow campaign.

The logos for its initiative for a non-tobacco future were first launched at the 2018 Japanese Grand Prix, and Mission Winnow took the title naming rights from the start of the following season.

However, the full Mission Winnow branding has been used on and off since then, with PMI ensuring it did not contravene any government restrictions over tobacco advertising laws.

In 2020, Ferrari ran without the branding for the entire season, before a new green logo and the wording reappeared at the start of this campaign.

However, it was announced earlier this year that the Mission Winnow branding would again be taken off for EU races.

There had been speculation suggesting that ongoing regulatory uncertainty could prompt PMI to quit F1 completely, but Ferrari suggests that there is a chance the company will retain some involvement.

Asked about whether or not Mission Winnow would remain as title sponsor with its stickers on the car next year, Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto said: "We are still discussing with PMI.

"It is very likely PMI will remain, [but] maybe not as a title sponsor. So maybe let's see.

"It can depend on what do you mean by Mission Winnow, on the car or not. You mentioned stickers, so we're discussing rights. It will be announced as soon as we are ready to do it."

When PMI announced earlier this year that it was removing its Mission Winnow branding for EU races, the company expressed some frustration at the way its non-tobacco campaign was being treated.

Riccardo Parino, VP Global Partnerships at Philip Morris, said: "Mission Winnow respects all laws and regulations and continuously strives to find distinctive ways to drive dialogue, free of ideology, and build strong partnerships that are rooted in shared values.

"We acknowledge the mistrust and abundance of scepticism towards our industry.

"However, our intention is not to create controversy around the application of the logo but rather focus on re-framing global conversations, building communities, and supporting innovative ideas that drive positive change."

However, a combination of poor reliability, strategy and driver errors, and rapid progress from Red Bull, meant that the team was unable to sustain its championship challenge for long enough.

But although its title hopes faded, that did not stop it trying to continue to eke out performance from its 2022 challenger.

Ferrari airbox detail

As the F1-75 was unveiled, it became apparent that the team had returned to the triangular roll over hoop and airbox design of it 2020 challenger, dispensing with the two channels that had flanked it in 2021 and made the airbox appear to be more of an oval. The L-shaped winglets mounted on the side of the airbox also remained.

Ferrari F1-75 front wing detail

, like many others on the grid, wished to build in some adaptability with its nose design and opted to employ a vanity panel on the forward section. This would allow it to make changes easily, without the huge financial burden of designing, building and crash testing an entirely new nose.

Ferrari F1-75 open nose detail

In the front view, without the vanity panel in place, we can see how the structural portion of the nose doesn’t extend all the way to the tip, allowing the team to make changes to how it connects to the front wing, if necessary.

Ferrari F1-75 floor detail

The original floor edge design employed by Ferrari saw a small cutout towards the rear third of the floor, with another tongue-like flap that bobbed out from beneath. The flap being housed at a different height to the floor would help redirect the airflow before the rear tyre and thus help mitigate some of the effects posed by tyre squirt.

Ferrari F1-75 side pods

The stylised sidepod solution seen on the F1-75 proved to be a very different approach to what most teams had opted for in 2022, with the bathtub-like central depression not only providing a very different visual but also an interesting aerodynamic spin, especially when you consider the cooling gills that lined the bodywork.

Ferrari F1-75 and McLaren MCL36 floor comparison

Having noted the edge wing design of ’s during the first pre-season test / shakedown in Barcelona, Ferrari tried its own version in Bahrain. The design was an expansion upon its preconceived idea, albeit with a much larger edge wing and flap now able to influence the airflow. You’ll also note that Ferrari added a metal stay for the rear section of the floor to help reduce flexibility.

Ferrari F1-75 t-tray damper

Images from the pitlane of the F1-75 in various states of undress gave us the desired view of the bib section, which is not only hinged under the chassis to allow some deflection, there’s also a damper employed to help control it.

Ferrari F1-75 rear wing Saudi Arabian GP

Ferrari introduced a new, lower downforce, spoon-shaped rear wing iteration for the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, as the team looked to shed some drag for the high speed sectors.

Ferrari F1-75 engine cooling

A shot of the F1-75 as it was being prepared for action but bereft of the sidepod bodywork reveals how the radiators are positioned and the baffles attached to help improve flow around them. Also note how the intake has a mounting that attaches it to the lower side impact spar.

Ferrari diffuser comparison

Ferrari made changes to the boat tail section of the diffuser in Australia, narrowing the central section to alter the available volume and improve ride height sensitivity.

Ferrari F1-75 bottom view

The underfloor of the F1-75 proved to be an area where the team spent plenty of resources as it searched for more performance.

Ferrari F1-75 new floor

Ferrari added an ‘Ice Skate’ to the edge of the underfloor similar to the one first introduced by Red Bull. The skate not only assists aerodynamically but it also limits the floor's travel to improve ride height sensitivity.

Ferrari F1-75 rear wing comparison

Ferrari added a high downforce rear wing to its suite of options for the Spanish Grand Prix, with the spoon-shaped mainplane and the upper flap’s geometry altered across the wing’s span to help produce more downforce.

Changes were also made to the outer floor fence, enlarging the surface when compared with the old specification (dotted yellow line). Also note the bib wing which the team copied ahead of its own launch, having seen a version on the Aston Martin which had launched its car a week earlier than the Scuderia.

Ferrari F1-75 floor comparison

The changes made to the underfloor included a stepped edge to the boat tail section of the floor [1], a different cutout and edge wing arrangement and the ice skate strake [2].

Ferrari F1-75 front brakes

A look at the F1-75’s front brake assembly without the drum in place, showing the inlet that straddles the fence, the pipework that delivers cool air to the caliper and is treated with a thermal coating. It’s also worth noting that Ferrari didn’t use a fairing to cover the brake disc like many of its rivals did, which does have a bearing on the transfer of heat between the various surfaces.

Ferrari F1-75 rear wing Azerbaijan GP

The lower downforce rear wing that Ferrari had at its disposal in Miami but opted not to race reappeared in Baku. The wing featured a much shallower central mainplane section, resulting in a steeper transition in the outer section.

Ferrari F1-75 rear wing comparison

Another new specification rear wing appeared for the Canadian Grand Prix but was only available for . It had features that reduced downforce and drag in a different way to the specification used by Sainz.

A look at the sidepod intake without the radiator in place shows the spars used to help alter the course of the airflow as it approaches.

Ferrari F1-75 new mirror, British GP

Ferrari made changes to the wing mirror housing and stalks at the British Grand Prix, with the inboard stalk sharpened to create more of a vortex generating surface and the outboard stalk moved to make room on the housing for the introduction of a couple of extra vortex inducing fins.

Ferrari F1-75 sidepods detail

The sidepod bodywork was altered for the British Grand Prix, with the undercut tightened to improve the airflow’s passage to the rear of the car.

Ferrari F1-75 sidepods comparison

Alterations were also made at the rear of the sidepod and engine cover bodywork to help improve internal and external flow.

Ferrari F1-75 turning vanes comparison

To help redistribute the airflow’s passage both under and over the floor, the team made a change to the height of the floor’s leading edge, creating a two-tier surface, rather than just the more simplified graduation seen before and elsewhere.

Ferrari F1-75 new floor comparison

The split level floor can be seen here in the rear ¾ view, along with the changes made to the outer floor fence, which had been enlarged further still when compared with the outgoing specification (inset).

Another angle to look at the changes to the floor’s leading edge [1] and outer floor fence [2], whilst also giving us an opportunity to see the changes made to the floor’s central section, as the team took inspiration from others by adding more contouring [3].

Ferrari F1-75 rear wing comparison, Belgian GP

Ferrari had a brief spell during FP1 for the Belgian Grand Prix where it tried the rear wing designated for Monza. This not only provided clues as to whether it would perform as expected at the Italian Grand Prix but opened the door for its use in Belgium, if it didn’t result in too much time being lost in the middle sector. The team opted to return to the option previously seen at Baku in order to better serve that middle sector, whilst not dramatically impacting the first and third sectors.

Ferrari F1-75 rear wing detail

The lower downforce wing seen in Belgium made a return for the Italian Grand Prix, albeit with the one-off livery emblazoned upon it.

A new, single element, beam wing was also employed at Monza, as the team looked to reduce downforce and drag for the high speed venue.

Ferrari F1-75 front wing detail

In order to balance the car front-to-rear the team also trimmed the front wing’s upper flap.

An overview of the rear layout of Charles Leclerc’s steering wheel shows that the Monegasque driver prefers a single, long-arm clutch paddle with finger sockets; he operates with his right hand.

Meanwhile, Sainz continues with a similar layout to his time at McLaren, with two paddles, one either side, which allows him to choose which he’ll use to modulate the clutch. Note that the gear selector paddles are also shaped differently as a consequence.

Ferrari F1-75 sidepods comparison

The Japanese Grand Prix marked the point in the calendar where the Scuderia turned cheek on 2022 completely, having switched development to its 2023 challenger long before that. The outer floor fence, which had been the focus of a great deal of development for the team, was reprofiled once more, with the lower forward cutout shape changed once more.

Ferrari F1-75 new floor, Japanese GP

Meanwhile, work had been done to improve the strength of the floor whilst reducing some of its weight, resulting in the metal stay being moved to a higher position on the inboard ramped portion of the floor.

Ferrari F1-75 old floor

For comparison, this is the older floor specification with the metal stay on the outboard section of the floor, whilst the carbon weave (inset) of the floor had also been reoriented.

Ferrari F1-75 floor comparison

To help gather some real world data for 2023, Ferrari ran a different floor specification at the last race of the season, in Abu Dhabi. The floor featured a revised section just ahead of the rear wheels, with the lip of the floor rolled upwards, rather than being turned down (inset, right).

saw its streak of eight consecutive constructors’ championship victories come to an end this year as it struggled to get to grips with the new technical regulations.

The team was blighted by a porpoising issue through pre-season testing before deeper problems with the W13 car emerged in the early part of the season, leaving it well behind  and Red Bull in the battle at the front.

But Mercedes managed to develop the car in a direction that allowed it to remedy many of the problems and regain performance, allowing it to win the penultimate race of the year in Brazil.

Its recovery has left Ferrari driver Leclerc confident Mercedes will be back in the thick of the fight at the head of the pack next year, setting up a possible three-team fight along with Red Bull.

"I do believe that Mercedes will be in the fight,” said Leclerc, who scored three wins this year for Ferrari. “Another team? I haven't seen signs yet maybe to believe that another team will join the top three.

“But Mercedes will definitely be there next year with a very strong car. We've seen how much they've improved from the first race to the last race.

“I think they understood what they did wrong, and this is normally the sign that it will go better.

“So hopefully it will be a three-team fight next year.”

Ferrari managed to hold on for second place in the constructors’ standings ahead of Mercedes despite going on a winless run from the Austrian Grand Prix in mid-July until the end of the season.

The Italian team spent the early part of the year evenly matched with Red Bull for performance, winning two of the first three races, only to lose ground as the year wore on.

But Leclerc expressed his confidence that Ferrari would be able to learn from its struggles through 2022 and get on top of them in time for the new campaign starting in Bahrain next March.

“I am confident because we are doing quite a lot of work at the simulator,” said Leclerc. “We’ve been working extremely hard in the past year to try and understand what were the weaknesses of this car in order to get better for next year’s car.

“I also think that after the 2021 season, where we've been working very well and reset it a little bit from 2020 that was a difficult season, we have been working in the right direction and in the right way.

“This gives me the confidence that we'll have a competitive car for 2023.”

Leclerc looked poised to mount a title challenge for the first time in his F1 career after winning two of the first three races, surging into an early points lead thanks to the victories in Bahrain and Australia.

But Leclerc would score just one more win all season as  and Red Bull pulled ahead in the fight, aided by a car that was clearly a step ahead in performance from the summer break onwards.

It left Leclerc fighting for second place come the end of the season, ultimately pipping Verstappen’s team-mate, , to runner-up honours by three points. The  driver collected his trophy for second in the F1 championship on Friday at the FIA’s prize giving in Bologna.

Asked if splitting the Red Bull drivers in the final standings offered him much satisfaction, Leclerc replied: “Not too much satisfaction, to be honest.

“Looking back at the season, I think it's been a good season, especially looking at 2020 and 2021 that have been two very difficult years for the team.

“It wasn't a given that we would do such a step forward and finish second in the drivers' championship and also second in the constructors' championship. So for that I'm happy.

“So mixed feelings about this season. But second place is quite good. I just hope it is a step forward, and that for next year, we can do another step forward.”

Leclerc retired from the lead of a race on three occasions, suffering an engine failure in Spain and Azerbaijan before spinning out of the lead in France.

Strategy miscues by Ferrari in Great Britain and Hungary also did not help Leclerc’s cause as the summer races swung the championship momentum in Verstappen’s favour.

Leclerc’s mistake in France led to one of the most emotive moments of the season when he screamed into the radio out of frustration over his error, knowing he had a good chance of victory.

"I think in the heat of the moment and in the heat of the season, races are coming quite quickly,” Leclerc said when discussing the challenge to keep frustration under control.

“So I think it's OK. It's just at the end of the season, then you look back at the season and you feel it a bit more. But during the season, it wasn't that difficult."

DATE: 2022

Following ’s failure to win the world championship this year, Binotto offered his resignation after feeling he did not have the full support of the Italian manufacturer’s senior management team.

Ferrari accepted his decision to quit and is currently finalising a replacement, with  team boss Frederic Vasseur favourite to take the job.

Binotto’s departure could disrupt the form of one of Red Bull’s chief rivals, with Horner conceding the good job the Swiss-born Italian had done at Maranello.

Asked by Motorsport.com at the FIA Gala Awards in Italy if he was surprised by the events at Ferrari, Horner said: “I think, in all fairness to Mattia, he did a very good job in producing a very competitive car and engine for Ferrari, certainly this year. Obviously, they had their moments operationally.

“He committed a long period of his career and life to Ferrari, and I'm sure it must be very difficult for him to leave that team after all of that time.

“So, of course, a huge pressure in that team, because it's a national team effectively, as well as an OEM team. And I think that it will now be the sixth team principal that I will sit across the table from, since I've been at Red Bull and, obviously, you know, a lot of pressure on that job.”

Horner attended Friday night’s FIA gala to collect Red Bull’s first constructors’ championship trophy since 2013.

Reflecting on the battle with Ferrari this year, he singled out ’s victory at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix as a key moment in getting Red Bull’s championship ambitions back on track after a difficult start to the year.

“I think they [Ferrari] had a faster car than us in the early part of the season,” he said.

“But we were able to stay in touch and that was very, very important.

“Our championship was 21 races, because we missed the first one by having a double DNF. But we had to stick with them.

“And, for me, one of the crucial weekends was Imola with the sprint race, and then the victory. To win both those races to achieve the 1-2 finish and to beat Ferrari on their home ground was, I think, psychologically a big thing for us as a team, potentially for them as well.

“I think then, as we developed the car, and we improved the car, and we lost a little bit of weight, then the speed came.”

DATE: 2022

The team announced recently that current incumbent Mattia Binotto has resigned and will leave at the end of December, with his replacement yet to be confirmed.

boss Fred Vasseur, who has worked extensively with Leclerc in the past at both ART and Sauber, is widely regarded as a favourite to get the job.

"Mattia called me to announce that he would stop,” said Leclerc. “I respect his decision. And I can only thank him. Obviously he has believed in me right from the start, he extended me with a very, very long contract.

"And before being team principal, he was also inside the Scuderia for many, many years and he has contributed to the success that the team had in the past years.

“So I wish him the best. And obviously now it's up to us to focus on the future, and try and take the right choices in order to be a bit more of a challenge to Red Bull next year.”

Leclerc downplayed the suggestion that a change of boss could be disruptive because of a change of approach.

"To be honest, I don't know because from my own experience, I've never had a team principal change when I was racing for the same team," he said. "It will probably require a little bit of time for the team principal to get at ease with the system, and with , because it's obviously a huge team.

“But I believe that if it's done the right way, I don't think we will suffer any of it on the track. So I am pretty sure it will be a smooth transition."

Leclerc stressed that he will not have any input into who might replace Binotto, noting that the decision would be made by Ferrari chairman John Elkann and CEO Benedetto Vigna.

"I won't comment that,” he said when asked if he had a personal preference. “And obviously it's also not my decision, John and Benedetto are going to take the decision.

“And we are just trying to focus on our job in the simulator, with the team, in order to have the best race car possible for next year. But the decision will be done by them."

However, when asked if Vasseur would be a good fit, he made it clear that he has a good relationship with his former boss.

"I mean, Ferrari is a very different team to any other teams. I can only comment on my experience with Fred which obviously has been good.

"I've been working with Fred already from the junior categories, where he has believed in me, and then we've always had a good relationship.

“But apart from that, obviously this shouldn't influence any of the decisions. He has always been very straightforward, very honest. And this is something that I liked from Fred.

“Whether it will be him or not, I don't know. And we'll see hopefully in the in the next few months."

DATE: 2022

Wolff and Binotto went head-to-head on a number of issues while heading up their respective teams over the past four seasons, particularly through 2019 amid concerns about the legality of ’s power unit.

Ferrari announced  and would leave Maranello at the end of the month, ending a 28-year stint with the Scuderia. The news has left one of the most high-profile jobs in F1 vacant, with Ferrari saying it would finalise a replacement in the new year.

Speaking on F1’s Beyond the Grid podcast,  team principal Wolff said it was “no secret” that he and Binotto “had our moments” in recent years, but felt they had been “consolidated” through 2022.

“We were in a much better place,” said Wolff. “But it was always clear that he was under tremendous pressure. Being a team principal at Ferrari, you better have a good contract for your exit.

“Now, probably the unavoidable happened, but he held onto it longer than I thought.”

As well as being Ferrari’s F1 team principal, Binotto was also its technical chief after taking up the role in 2016. Prior to that, he oversaw Ferrari’s engine division, giving him one of the most expansive CVs in the paddock.

Asked if Binotto’s experience and pedigree would ever make him of interest to work at Mercedes, potentially overseeing its High Performance Powertrains arm, Wolff ruled out the possibility.

“No, I think there was too much porcelain broken between us the last two years that this would be possible,” said Wolff.

“With the other teams, I can’t say. But certainly Mattia understands Formula 1 inside out, and yeah, maybe he finds a role in another team.”

Alfa Romeo's Frederic Vasseur has been tipped as Mattia Binotto's successor at Ferrari.

Frederic Vasseur, the team principal of , is the current favourite to take over at Ferrari, but Wolff felt it was “very difficult to judge” who would be the right fit for the role.

“You need to understand motor racing, maybe more than just Formula 1,” Wolff said.

“But it’s such a niche where the sport, the regulations, the governing body, the commercial rights holder, the competitors, all of us are basically locked in this paddock cage. You need to be politically astute.

“It’s a very niche, specialist environment. The more you know about the sport, the better it is. But you don’t want to be a one-trick pony either.

“You can be a good racing manager, and not understand about anything that's going on commercially or outside in the world.”

DATE: 2022

Despite a lacklustre start to the campaign, when it struggled with reliability and was on the back foot in pace terms, Red Bull successfully turned its season around.

A combination of weight reduction and aero improvements to the RB18 made it the dominant car after the summer break, and  had nothing in response – especially when it stopped car development because of cost cap limits.

Reflecting on the ebb and flow of the 2022 season, Ferrari’s senior performance engineer Jock Clear felt that Red Bull got it right in ensuring it had the freedom with its spending to make steps forward when it needed to.

“I think that's probably Red Bull's strength this year, as they look to have been flexible,” said Clear.

“There were times when it was a bit of a Muhammad Ali approach. It looked like you've got them on the ropes and they just squirm a bit and come out and ‘bang’. And you are like: ‘Oh, my God, where did they find that?’

“I think that's just the experience they've had as world champions. And that's what we have to get used to doing.

“This year has been a great help. We've been at the front, we've been fighting at the front. We've learned a huge amount this year and we're on a steep learning curve, as are all the teams.”

Clear says one of the key things that Ferrari needs to understand better for 2023 is in how to deploy its resources over the campaign to maximise car performance and return under the cost cap.

He suspects Ferrari paid the price late in the season for committing more spending on car development early on, while Red Bull was more consistent throughout.

“The difficulty is to know where you're going to be spending your money most efficiently and most effectively,” he said. “And that has to take a little bit of planning.

“Of course, as that planning plays out, you learn that maybe you took some wrong decisions earlier on for a path you're now on.

“Red Bull have obviously done a very good job of reacting to where they've seen the pressure, but not losing sight of the fact that they have to focus on just bringing performance to the car.

“And I think from our point of view, we've done everything we planned to do this year. But it's a relative sport.

“So yeah, we have underperformed compared to Red Bull in the second half of the year, but you would say that  have left it all too late, if you see what I mean.

“Between the three teams, you've got us maybe pushing a bit too early on, Mercedes pushing a bit late, and Red Bull striking the right balance. And we have to learn from that.”

But while Ferrari was disappointed to lose out to Red Bull over the season, Clear says the scale of his team’s progress should not be underestimated.

“We've certainly made a big step forward this year,” he said. “We did come into the last few races and think, ‘oh, what could have been’, but it's amazing how quickly you reset your goals.

“And, if you had offered this 12 months ago, we would have ripped your arm off. We're very proud of what we've managed to do this year.

“It’s a big, big step forward. Now we have to maintain it. We have stopped developing this car earlier in the season with a view to making sure that we stay competitive next year and we are right on the nail at the first race.”

DATE: 2022

’s 2022 engine was a good step forward this year, with outgoing boss Mattia Binotto claiming that the Maranello squad had made the biggest progress season to season that he had ever known.

"On the power unit, we set big numbers in terms of objectives,” he said over the summer. “And what I've seen that we have been capable of developing during last season for 2022 on the power unit, in more than 25 years in Maranello, I never saw that.”

However, as the Italian manufacturer pushed hard on performance with F1’s engine freeze locking in development, it did suffer some reliability problems.

Binotto subsequently revealed at the end of the year that the team had had to wind down its power over the second half of the campaign to ensure it did not hit repeat trouble.

But, as revealed by Motorsport.com,  in Abu Dhabi after getting to the bottom of its earlier issues.

That has set the squad up for maximum performance from its engine in 2023, which could boost the title hopes of  and  as well as the form of its customer teams.

Steiner, appearing at the Lorenzo Bandini Trophy Awards ceremony in Faenza at the weekend where driver  collected the accolade, has offered clues about optimism from within Ferrari.

“On Thursday I met Mattia Binotto and he told me that next season's engine will be the bomb,” he said.

“In Emilia Romagna, there is a lot of support for Ferrari. And if it [the engine] is competitive, it will be positive for us too.”

Steiner added he was encouraged by the progress that Haas made in 2022, which included a shock pole position for Kevin Magnussen at the Brazilian Grand Prix, but said the team’s targets had not been met yet.

"We've had two difficult years with the pandemic,” he said. “The championship that just ended went well, but it could also have gone better.

“We consider it a year of growth: Magnussen gave us a pole position that wasn't in the plans and in 2023 we want to grow further. The goal is to make another step forward in the standings, to always fight for points and one day get on the podium".

Speaking just down the road from rival , which Haas edged in the constructors’ championship this year, Steiner said that the efforts of parts supplier Dallara, and input from technical director Simone Resta, left him confident about prospects for 2023.

“You'll see next year we will have a single-seater that will represent a step forward,” he said. “We hope to beat AlphaTauri again.”

DATE: 2022

The Italian outfit began the year as the team to beat, with  winning two of the opening three grands prix of the campaign.

As well as having the fastest car in terms of out-and-out pace, the early phase of the season was notable also for  mostly enjoying better tyre degradation than rival Red Bull.

However, as Red Bull began to take weight off its RB18, its tyre life improved and, by the second half of the season, it was Ferrari that was struggling to look after its rubber as much.

While it looked from the outside that Ferrari had taken a dive with its tyre life, with Red Bull making huge gains, the team does not think things panned out exactly like that.

Instead, it suspects that its reduced tyre life was a consequence of it no longer having the fastest car – which meant its drivers were having to push harder to keep up with Red Bull, and that meant punishing its rubber more.

Jock Clear, Ferrari’s senior performance engineer, said about the impression the team’s tyre degradation got worse: “I think that's a misconception to be honest.

“I think what we've struggled with is ultimate pace. We've got two drivers who got used to 12/13 races at the beginning of the year where they could fight toe-to-toe with Red Bull.

“Red Bull pulled out a little bit of a two-tenth gap, which meant that we weren't quite able to nail the pole positions. So we were playing a little bit of catch up.

"And, of course, then you're trying to race a car that's actually quicker than you, and that will just manifest itself in tyre deg I'm afraid. So we don't think that's a big issue for us.”

Clear reckons that on the races where the performance of the Ferrari and the Red Bull were quite equal, that actually there was little to choose between them in terms of tyre deg.

“Over the course of the year, when the cars were balanced, our tyre deg was slightly better than Red Bulls,” he said.

“But now [at the end of the season] we're suffering from Charles going out there and just trying to keep up with Red Bull. And unfortunately, it's a slightly quicker car.

“You just thrash your tyres a little bit too much, trying to hang on to it. And of course, it's very difficult for Charles to say: ‘Okay, I can't keep up, I'm just gonna let him go.’ He's a racing driver. That's not going to happen.

“So you're just using a bit too much juice and you pay for that in the long stints.”

After losing out on the world title to Verstappen, Leclerc reckoned that getting a better grip on tyre management was as important as improving its reliability and strategy for 2023.

“Reliability has been a problem at one point of the season, which we paid the price for later on with penalties and other things,” he said at the season finale in Abu Dhabi.

“Strategy, I think we've done too many mistakes at one point of the season, and tyre management, we haven't been consistent enough at our 100 percent.

“Abu Dhabi was a good race but we also sometimes have very bad races and we don't seem to have the understanding yet of how to have a good tyre management all the time.

“These are the three key aspects in which we are focusing on at the moment."

DATE: 2022

The Italian F1 squad announced earlier this week that it had  as team principal after just less than four years in the job.

Binotto’s decision came off the back of a rollercoaster season for Ferrari, where the highs of early season race victories were clouded by later frustrations over poor reliability, strategy errors and driver mistakes.

In the end, Binotto made his decision after feeling he did not have the total trust of Ferrari chairman John Elkann and CEO Benedetto Vigna.

Ferrari has said it hopes to install a new team boss in the New Year, but there is already a widespread belief that the squad has heavily compromised its chances for 2023 by losing Binotto’s talent and experience on both the technical and management front.

Speaking in London at the Guild of Motoring Writers’ Annual Awards dinner on Thursday night, Brundle conceded that Ferrari was always in a unique position as a team because of its following in Italy.

“You're working for a country there at Ferrari, not just a team, of course,” said Brundle, who was made an honorary member of the Guild.

“They've lost their chief technical officer and their team principal, so unless they have got somebody very, very good to replace him straightaway, it all looks a little bit strange. But that's the nature of it.”

Philip Schofield and Martin Brundle

Brundle joked that he ‘quite fancied the job himself’, before more seriously suggesting that perhaps the squad needed to look for someone who would not be as heavily under the spotlight of the Italian media as Binotto was.

“You've got to speak Italian,” he said. “And I think the problem is, if you look back at when they were last successful, they had a Frenchman in Jean Todt, a Brit in Ross Brawn, a South African with Rory Byrne and so on.

“Maybe that's what they need again, something like that: people who are not completely exposed to the daily Italian media.”

DATE: 2022

Tuesday's announcement that Binotto would be leaving his role as team principal at the end of the season came following weeks of speculation he was being ushered towards the exit after 28 years.

said in the statement making Binotto's departure official that the process to find a new team principal was "underway" and "expected to be finalised in the new year."

F1 boss Frederic Vasseur is the favourite for the job, with the links dating back several weeks as the rumours began to swirl in the paddock.

But replacing the man at the very top of the F1 operation is not the only challenge that Ferrari chairman John Elkann and CEO Benedetto Vigna now face: they also need to find a new technical chief.

Upon taking the reins at Ferrari in 2019, Binotto adopted an unconventional dual role running the team, as no replacement was promoted into his previous role as technical chief.

Binotto rose through the ranks at Maranello after starting out as an engineer, becoming the head of Ferrari's engine department before taking over as chief technical officer in 2016 following the departure of James Allison.

As a result, Binotto has remained involved with the technical department at Ferrari over the past four seasons, delegating some responsibilities while maintaining supervision and also operating as team principal.

It means Ferrari now faces the task of filling not one but two of the most senior roles in its F1 team, seemingly without any in-house replacements who are ready to step in. On the team principal side, proof of this comes in the fact Ferrari did not have a successor ready to name upon confirming Binotto's departure, prompting it to look outside of the team.

Unless Ferrari can find someone with a similar background to Binotto who would be capable of the dual role as both team principal and technical chief, it is likely its internal structure will need to change, potentially returning to the more conventional approach of having a bespoke technical boss.

But the added challenge on this front is that many of the top names established in F1 will be subject to long periods of gardening leave.

When Aston Martin secured Dan Fallows from Red Bull to join as its new technical chief, it took 10 months before he could start work - and that was only after a deal was struck to shorten his gardening leave.

It would be a big ask for Ferrari to get someone from outside of the team in time for the 2023 season, meaning an internal promotion is likely - although this will also require a rejigging of its technical department.

As important as it will be for Ferrari to find the right person to head up the team moving forward in the wake of Binotto's departure, securing a strong technical chief is the other key battle it now faces, particularly given the strength of those departments at Red Bull and .

Binotto's exit has created a domino effect that is more complex than appointing a like-for-like replacement, should any even exist. It means there is little time to waste if Ferrari wants to have a stable leadership in place so it can mount a sustained challenge for both titles in 2023 and end its drought.

DATE: 2022

However much Binotto became an easy target for the critics amid Ferrari's reliability and strategy errors that grabbed the headlines in 2022, it was his many under-the-radar qualities that were key to having got the squad back to the front in the first place.

And, after a season where it learned some tough lessons about the perfection needed to be a championship contender, the ramifications of a new boss coming in could be immense.

As a team boss who understood the technical aspects of engines, cars, and their operation, as well as the political machinations of the F1 paddock, the FIA, and the media, Binotto's remit stretched large and wide for what is perhaps the most high-pressured job on the grid.

In losing Binotto,  is instantly without a team boss who had perhaps the most in-depth comprehension amongst his peers of car/engine design and performance parameters, as well as a direct understanding of the challenges and compromises of making a race-winning package.

Winning in F1 is all about marginal gains, and the knowledge that Binotto had of Ferrari's concepts and motivations was going to be critical in helping the squad make the step needed to get back on terms with Red Bull in 2023 – and fight off the renewed threat from .

Binotto's imminent departure will leave Ferrari without that detailed insight at perhaps the most critical moment of the year as it pulls its new car together.

It will take any new team boss who comes in many months to get a grip of Ferrari's design direction, structure and cost-cap spending plan. And, by the time they get up to speed with things, the 2023 title battle could be all but lost already.

Mattia Binotto, Team Principal, Ferrari

Getting calls wrong in the early stages of next year could cost immediate laptime if the team ends up going down the wrong path, and spending restrictions mean little opportunity for U-turns.

Binotto also fully understood the dynamics of Maranello politics, having been in the team since 1995, working first in the engine department and then moving up the ranks.

He saw how it worked when he was part of the system and, after stepping up to the team principal role, put in place below him the structure he thought best to help push it forward.

With Ferrari under Binotto's predecessor Maurizio Arrivabene having completely mismanaged its handling of chassis technical director James Allison during his tenure from 2013 to 2016, it was clear that inherent weaknesses in the system had to be addressed if the squad was to make the most of the talent it needed.

Binotto did much to improve things and it is little wonder then that sources suggest the mood in Maranello now has sunk deeply as the reality of losing him hits home. Don't rule out other resignations in the weeks to come.

This is not to say that Binotto was not without his weaknesses and did not make mistakes.

Ferrari's reliability problems this year were not ideal. But, at the start of the engine freeze era (as /Renault also showed), it was always clear that if teams wanted to maximise performance over the long term, there was going to be some short-term pain in pushing parameters over the limit.

It was Ferrari's strategy blunders this year that triggered most of the criticisms aimed at Binotto, though, especially as many viewed him weak for not sacking those responsible for the slip-ups.

But Binotto's mentality was always one of supporting individuals and making sure that, if mistakes were made once, then they were not repeated.

To the outside, he often appeared calm and polite when it came to addressing team mistakes; as he moved to protect those working underneath him. But behind the scenes, he was a hard taskmaster.

As he told Motorsport.com earlier this year: "I think I'm empowering the people which are around me. I think I'm not brutal, but I'm strict. And people around me know that I can be very strict."

While axing some of his senior strategy staff may have given the impression in public of a strong and decisive team boss; the reality was that it would not have made things better within the team.

As its tyre execution in Abu Dhabi showed, learning why things had gone wrong, improving strategy software to prevent incorrect information from being fed to the pitwall, and getting better processes in place, was a much better way of making things better.

Binotto was also perhaps too nice at times in not criticising his squad when things went wrong, and did sometimes lose out when speaking in his non-native tongue.

His famous mid-season comment about Ferrari's prospects to win all the races over the second half of the year came from the right place of being a supportive team boss, but came back to haunt him as Red Bull's title challenge ramped up.

"There is no reason why not to win 10 races from now to the end," he said after  had thrown away victory in France. "I think that the way to look at it is positively, and I like to be positive - staying optimistic."

Ferrari did not win another race.

There could also be an aspect that perhaps Binotto had too much on his plate, as trying to help oversee alone the technical, management, political, and commercial aspects of Ferrari, as well as dealing with the FIA, opened the risk of him being a jack of all trades, master of none.

Binotto never shied away from the fact that the criticism thrown at the squad this year was hard to deal with on a personal level.

But he said he was always clear that he felt duty-bound to protect staff from all the politics swirling around.

Asked by Motorsport.com about the challenges of 2022, Binotto said: "It has certainly been a difficult one because criticism is never easy to be managed.

"And more than that, I think for me, somehow [I needed to] try to keep the team focused and concentrated on the job.

"The criticisms are there to distract a team, and keeping a team focused is never easy. It has been difficult, but I think that will make me only stronger in the future.

"I know that we need to count only on ourselves. That is the most important lesson of the season."

But at the very time when Binotto needed to count on Ferrari, and for chairman John Elkann and CEO Benedetto Vigna to give him the full support he needed, he was let down.

Charles Leclerc, Ferrari, Mattia Binotto, Team Principal, Ferrari

There was a clear opportunity for Ferrari to suggest that he bring in someone senior alongside him to ease him of any responsibilities that were a distraction, and drill down deep in addressing the team's weak spots. This would have been understandable and a positive step for 2023.

Ultimately though, without the backing from above, Binotto knew his days were numbered and the decision was made to offer his resignation. Ferrari must now find a replacement.

But whoever Ferrari gets in as Binotto's successor is going to inherit a bit of a poisoned chalice, as there will be no excuses for anything less than dominating F1 next year.

Vigna recently remarked in an interview with CNBC that he was not willing to accept finishing runner-up.

"I said it after the last quarter, I am not satisfied with second place because second is first of the losers," he told the broadcaster.

"We have made some progress. I'm happy with the progress we've made. I'm not happy with second place. I think the team has what it takes to improve over time."

This effectively means that it is win or bust for next year, which puts a ridiculous amount of pressure on a new team boss to get their feet under the desk and pull instant results out of the hat.

It is something that, when going up against the might of Red Bull and Mercedes in the cost cap era, is simply not going to happen.

And if that instant winning form isn't there, then there is a risk of extra criticism, destabilising forces infecting the team, and then the prospect of a rampant blame culture forcing heads to roll to appease the doubters.

Ferrari's most successful era of modern times came when Jean Todt successfully kept Ferrari's racing team separated from the external politics and criticism that can drag it down.

And even when Ferrari lost drivers' championships it could have won in 1997 and 1998, there was no knee-jerk reaction to change the management.

Mattia Binotto, Team Principal, Ferrari

Things were progressing and it was just a question of giving it time to evolve and make the next step – as happened when it began a run of success that would last until the mid-2000s.

Binotto never shied away from the fact that getting Ferrari back to the front of F1 was a long-term project and was not going to happen overnight – and that is a story that rang true as much under the Todt era as it does now.

If anything, Ferrari's strong start to 2022 distorted the progress, as it far exceeded expectations and the trajectory they were on.

Things were also skewed by Red Bull underperforming in the first phase of the season with an overweight car. As Binotto rightly pointed out, trimming weight to find performance over the campaign is a much easier job than delivering the aero gains that Ferrari needed - so Red Bull was always on a better glide slope during the year.

As Ferrari hunts for a new team boss who knows that anything less than victory against Red Bull and Mercedes in 2023 will be viewed as a failure, Maranello is at risk of putting Binotto's replacement in an impossible position.

Unrealistic expectations to not finish second will prompt extreme reactions and further change, which then can trigger even more problems in the future, and the cycle repeats.

It is something Ferrari was guilty of in the past, and it's now very much opened up the risk of it becoming its biggest weakness in the future.

is expected to announce soon that the Frenchman is heading to Maranello as the replacement for Mattia Binotto,

even before Binotto’s departure was confirmed.

The 54-year-old joined Sauber in July 2017, shortly after the new shareholders - led by billionaire Finn Rausing - took over the then ailing organisation.

He has thus presided over the team for five and a half seasons, the last four under the name of main sponsor . In 2022 the team finished sixth in the world championship, its best result for a decade.

As CEO, , who will enter F1 under the new power unit rules in 2026.

The appeal of running Ferrari rather than leading Sauber through three interim seasons before the full Audi takeover proved irresistible to Vasseur.

In a statement the team paid tribute to its departing boss, making it clear that he will be missed.

Vasseur departs with the good wishes of the Sauber organisation behind Alfa Romeo's F1 operation

The team said: “Frederic Vasseur leaves a team bolstered by new partners, a growing workforce and with a bright future as the works team for a manufacturer in the not-too-far distance.

“He leaves as a friend, a mentor, a boss that could extract the best out of his charges.

“And, as we enter a new chapter of the history of our team, we will miss the smiles and jokes that would accompany him as he did the rounds in our Hinwil HQ.

“Merci, Fred, et bonne chance. We’ll be cheering for you wherever you go next.”

Vasseur stressed that he has enjoyed his stint with the team, suggesting that it was good preparation for his future job.

“As I prepare to bring my adventure at Alfa Romeo to an end, I can look back fondly at these six years together,” he said. “I owe a debt of gratitude to every single employee of the team, as they are the ones who got this team back on their feet and climbing the ladder of our sport.

“I am proud of the job we collectively have done as a team and a company, and even more so of the strong foundations we have laid for what’s to come next. But what I am the proudest of is the people that made this all possible, which in time have become friends.

“This team will always feel like home, and I’ll be rooting for it wherever I go. I have learnt so much during my stint as a CEO and team principal and I feel each day has equipped me for what is to come.

“I know Alfa Romeo will keep going from strength to strength and I’m looking forward to seeing them compete at the business end of the grid in the next few years.”

Vasseur led Alfa to sixth in the constructors' standings this year

Sauber chairman Rausing acknowledged the contribution that Vasseur has made to the team.

“Frederic gave our team six years of inspiring leadership and hard work, helping rebuild our company and our team,” said the Swede. “He was able to encourage every one of us into giving our best and the increasingly good results we have enjoyed are testament to the quality of his performance at the helm of the team.

“He was the first to believe in our project and he leaves a team in a much stronger, healthier position than when he arrived, with a bright future ahead of us, which is all that could have been asked of him.

“I am sure I echo everyone in the team when I wish Fred every success in his future endeavours.”

The Alfa/Sauber organisation has not yet announced who will replace Vasseur.

The decision by team principal  after the disappointments of the 2022 campaign has left the squad facing a more difficult winter than anticipated.

For whatever the qualities that Binotto's likely successor Fred Vasseur will bring with him, it is going to take time for him to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the organisation to work out where change is needed.

And amid F1’s cost cap era, making the wrong call on big decisions early in the campaign is something that can have big consequences for the long term.

But while questions remain about whether or not  has done the right thing in letting Binotto go, on the factory floor the focus is very much business as usual in pulling its 2023 F1 car together.

And for now, quite crucially, the team still retains the key technical input of Binotto, who remains under contract and working hard at Maranello until the end of the year.

The message from  at last weekend’s FIA Prize Gala in Bologna was very much one of the technical part of the team not getting distracted by the bigger infrastructure issues at the top of the organisation.

"I am confident because we are doing quite a lot of work at the simulator,” he said about the progress of the 2023 car.

“We've been working extremely hard in the past year to try and understand what were the weaknesses of this car in order to get better for next year's car.

“Obviously, there's also Mattia still at the factory at the moment, working and trying to help the team to get ready for 2023. And again, I believe that if the transition is done in the right way, we shouldn't suffer too much.

“I also think that after the 2021 season where we've been working very well and reset it a little bit from 2020, that was a difficult season, we have been working in the right direction and in the right way. And this gives me the confidence that we'll have a competitive car for 2023."

There certainly appears to be more confidence inside Ferrari than outside at the moment, and that is something that has not always been historically true.

And while changes will no doubt come when Vasseur has had time to get his feet under the desk, it does not appear that Ferrari is in need of a major revolution or upheaval. Minor adjustments in the way things are run could be enough to make the difference in that fight with Red Bull and .

The data emerging from the work in the wind tunnel appears to be very positive. The 675 project (as the 2023 car is currently known) will represent an important leap in quality compared to the F1-75. The engineers directed by vehicle project manager Enrico Cardile have focused on two key areas where it felt the team lost out to Red Bull in 2021.

First: it wants to improve its top speed with greater aerodynamic efficiency. The drag problem derived not only from the difference in speed with DRS open, but also from the approach to aero-elasticity of certain components – where perhaps Red Bull did things much more cleverly. And this counts not only for wings but also in the overall pitch of the car when it hits top speed on the straight.

The second area of focus has been tyre management. Pirelli has moved towards new front tyres to help reduce understeer, something that could well suit what Ferrari’s concept needs as well as the driving style of Leclerc.

In Maranello it has adapted the mathematical model of the new tyres in its simulation systems and the early results are positive.

Ferrari has also been smart in offering to do as much as it can to help out Pirelli with its 2023 tyre development programme, knowing that every bit of feedback it can give and it can get could be crucial when it comes down to performance on race weekends.

From the outside, the 675 will not be very different to the F1-75. The overall concept will remain similar but there will be some tweaks: most notably at the rear end thanks to a change that will allow a much more pronounced shape in the Coca-Cola region.

Another aspect that drives confidence is the progress that engine chief Enrico Gualtieri and his department have made with the reliability of the 066/7 power unit.

There have been positive signs from the test benches that the reliability problems that blighted the early phase of 2022 have been sorted, and that has lifted confidence of the team being able to turn its engine back up to full power next year.

DATE: 2022

The German car manufacturer went completely its own route for 2022, adopting a ‘zero sidepod’ solution on the W13, which was very different to the downwash Red Bull idea and the inwash  concept.

But while  endured difficulties with its 2022 challenger, the team remained adamant that its  solution.

And, with its key focus being on curing the porpoising problems that blighted the start to its campaign rather than worrying about the sidepods, changes it made to most other aspects of its car eventually helped turn its car in to a winner.

Mercedes trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin said that the team never felt that it needed to focus too much effort on the sidepod solution as it was not triggering a big performance deficit.

Plus, he pointed out, the team has always known that the best route to success in F1 was to push on with its own ideas than simply copy others.

“Most of the engineering, certainly from the aerodynamic point of view, a lot of it are the bits you can't see under the floor,” said Shovlin. “That is where a lot of that work is.

“The sidepod concept was something that we had to commit to anyway for the year realistically. But if we'd been more focused on just trying to find a quick fix, we may have been copying and rolling it out and seeing what it does.

“The goal for us though was always to try and understand it ourselves and learn and find our own path, because if you want to win, and you want to win races and world championships, you don't get there by copying everyone else's design.

“All our other cars have had pioneering features on them, they had clever ideas. We have tried to be leading with the technology, so we'll carry on doing that.”

Despite sticking steadfast to its sidepod solution for 2022, Mercedes could yet make a switch for next year as it ponders a rethink of its car concept.

Red Bull’s sidepod design was not the only thing that grabbed attention this year, because it was the team’s low-drag concept – which helped deliver impressive top speed – that gave it a big advantage over the course of the campaign.

Shovlin said that Mercedes, which suffered from high drag, was aware of the characteristic, but was not obsessed with simply boosting straightline speed potential in 2023.

“When you've got a completely new set of rules, it's difficult to know where everyone is going to design to,” he explained.

“Their car looks like it has less drag if we put the same wings on it. In the earlier part of the year, we were having to run very high [downforce levels], which was certainly not helping from that point of view.

“But if you look at Brazil, we didn't have the fastest car, but we could overtake them and we were able to get the 1-2. So making it quick in a straight line is not our highest priority. And one of the fastest in a straight line is the . So it doesn't define your performance level.

“But when you are very similar, obviously, it's a nice advantage to have. So it's something we'd like to fix. It's just that the priority will always be the base performance of the car and getting that in the right place.”

Mercedes managed to address most of its porpoising problems over the course of the campaign, but still encountered a few issues later in the season.

Shovlin says he is mindful of the problem returning as the team adds more downforce to the car over the winter, but he reckons new floor edge rules will also help it overcome some of its most obvious problems.

“The more you load up the floor, the more you can trigger those problems,” he said. “Where we have made very good progress is in the straightline. So back in Imola, Jeddah, Bahrain, all those early races, the car was bouncing really badly at high speed. And we managed to get a really good handle on that.

“There were still issues we got when the car rolled in a fast corner and the floor gets to a point where it's touching. And that can cause a bit of unsteadiness. But the rule changes for next year will help that.

“Fundamentally, though, they're not going to make the problem go away. They'll make it a bit easier for the teams. But we're hopeful that the work we put into the learning and the understanding in the early part of the year will help us at least develop to a good baseline next year.”

DATE: 2022

Mauro Forghieri's stint with  as technical director and both chassis and engine designer lasted from 1959 to 1987, and he is credited by the team with an involvement in 54 grand prix wins and nine world championships.

The fact that he survived for nearly three decades in an organisation noted for internal turmoil and a revolving door of top personnel says much about his close relationship with Enzo Ferrari. They didn’t always agree, but the Commendatore had a huge amount of respect for the younger man, and usually backed his vision.

Forghieri was born in Modena in 1935. His father Reclus was a machinist and mechanic who worked with Enzo Ferrari at  in the 1930s, and again from the early days of the new Ferrari marque after the Second World War.

The younger Forghieri studied mechanical engineering at the University of Bologna, and in 1957 he undertook a form of apprenticeship at Ferrari. At one stage, he considered moving to the United States to work in the aircraft industry, as planes were a big passion. Instead, when he graduated aged 24 in 1959, he stayed closer to home, joining Ferrari full-time.

Working initially under the volatile technical chief Carlo Chiti, Forghieri was involved with the development of the 1.5-litre Formula 1 V6 engine. He was thus part of the team’s traumatic 1961 season with the Sharknose 156 in which Phil Hill’s world title was overshadowed by the death of Wolfgang von Trips at Monza.

In October that year, Chiti and his key lieutenants were fired following a major fallout with Ferrari, and Forghieri was left as the most qualified engineer at Maranello. Ferrari took the bold decision to put the 26-year-old in charge of the whole racing department. Ferrari had a soft spot for the youngster, thanks to his long relationship with Forghieri’s father and the family’s origins in the Modena area, and they worked well together.

Paying tribute to Forghieri last week, Enzo’s son Piero described what it was like at Maranello in those days.

“When I joined the company in 1965, I shared an office with Cavalier Giberti, Ferrari’s first employee,” he said, “while Mauro Forghieri, taken on a few years earlier, was next door. We were therefore separated by 10 years of age and a window. We saw each other all day every day.

Forghieri exchanges notes with Surtees, pictured here in the Ferrari 156. He took its successor, the 158, to the 1964 world title

“Forghieri was energetic and passionate about everything he did. He was sanguine and I recall that in many of those interminable meetings at the Gestione Sportiva, that started in the evening and went on into the night, I mediated between him and my father. I know my father appreciated his tireless work ethic and he knew that any mistakes only came about through an attempt to do something better and to look ahead.”

One of Forghieri’s early projects was sorting the legendary 250 GTO, and over the years he would oversee the development of a string of classic GT and sportscar machines.

But his main focus was grand prix racing. The team had a difficult 1962 season with the now outpaced Sharknose, but form picked up after John Surtees joined in 1963, with the Englishman winning the German GP with the updated 156. Forghieri formed a good working relationship with the technically inclined Surtees, and for 1964 he designed the new 158 chassis, which would race with both V8 and flat-12 power.

Surtees won at the Nurburgring and Monza and, helped by a string of solid podium finishes, he clinched the 1964 title at the Mexico finale. Ferrari also won the constructors’ championship.

The team slipped back to fourth in 1965, the last year of the 1.5-litre formula, failing to win a race. Ferrari also faced intense competition from Ford in sportscar racing, and logged its sixth consecutive Le Mans win - and its last to date - that year with the 250 LM.

For F1’s move to three-litre power in 1966, Forghieri designed the 312 chassis and a new V12 engine. As rival new projects struggled to get up to speed, Ferrari had the potential to win the title. But after winning the Belgian GP at Spa, Surtees fell out with team manager Eugenio Dragoni and left. The opportunity was squandered.

The death of Lorenzo Bandini following a fiery crash in Monaco in 1967 was a major blow for the whole team, and that season there were no race wins. The final years of the decade were difficult for Ferrari. In 1968, Chris Amon took several poles and regularly led races with the 312, but the only success was scored by Jacky Ickx in France. That year, Forghieri conducted pioneering experiments with a rear wing, and he persuaded his boss to let him use a full-size windtunnel in Germany, putting a new focus on aerodynamics at a team where engine performance had always been the priority.

In 1969, Ferrari completed the sale of a shareholding in his company to Fiat, and he invested some of the funds into rebuilding the F1 team after another winless season. Forghieri was given some breathing space in a new Advanced Studies Office in Modena, away from the factory. There he created a new flat-12 engine that provided valuable weight distribution benefits and was a much better overall package than the V12.

The agile 312B chassis that it was mated to in 1970 proved to be very competitive in the hands of Ickx and Clay Regazzoni, with the Belgian winning three races and finishing a close second to the late Jochen Rindt in the title battle. There would be more wins for Ickx and Regazzoni in 1971-72, despite some issues getting the cars to work with its Firestone tyres, while Forghieri’s 312 PB proved successful in sportscar racing.

The Advanced Studies Office moved from Modena to the newly opened Fiorano test track at Maranello but, in 1973 and with Ferrari ill, Forghieri was switched sideways within the company by Fiat. Without him the F1 team lost its way, failing even to log a podium.

Forghieri was recalled to F1 duties by a recovered Enzo at the end of the year, and he would play a key role in an astonishing revival in fortunes. Ferrari’s other crucial move was to hire Niki Lauda, who had made a good impression at BRM in 1973. The young Austrian came in tandem with a returning Regazzoni, who had left Ferrari at the end of 1972 but was still favoured by the team boss.

Lauda and Forghieri quickly established a good relationship, and the engineer appreciated the new arrival’s willingness to test as often as necessary and offer unfiltered feedback. Not since Surtees had the team employed a driver with such an intense interest in technical matters.

“The fact that I was able to test regularly at Fiorano made genuine progress possible,” Lauda wrote later. “And meant that Forghieri could be encouraged to experiment and eliminate shortcomings.”

The new 312B3, a heavily revised version of the unsuccessful 1973 machine, proved to be very competitive in 1974. Lauda scored his first win in Spain and added another success in Holland, although the results didn’t reflect his true pace since he logged nine poles. Regazzoni won in Germany, and the rejuvenated team jumped from sixth to second in the constructors’ championship.

For 1975, Forghieri designed the heavily revised 312T, which featured a transverse gearbox ahead of the rear axle as he sought further benefits from optimum weight distribution. The attractive machine propelled Lauda to five GP victories and that year’s title, while the team also secured the constructors’ crown – both successes were the first achieved since 1964. Lauda later wrote that the 312T was a “permanent monument to Mauro Forghieri’s skill, a gem of a car”.

Lauda was the dominant force in early 1976, and he was heading for the title with the reworked 312T2 when he crashed at the Nurburgring. He returned to the cockpit just weeks later, but ultimately lost out to James Hunt at the famous Fuji finale. The constructors’ championship provided some compensation for Ferrari.

Lauda bounced back to win his second crown with the 312T2 in 1977, while the team logged a third straight constructors’ title. But by then he’d had enough of Ferrari polemics, and he moved on at the end of the year.

The brand new 312T3 was competitive in 1978 and won five championship races in the hands of Carlos Reutemann and Gilles Villeneuve, but it was quickly surpassed by the Lotus 79. Forghieri was obliged to design a ground-effects car for 1979, but the wide flat-12 engine didn’t lend itself to the concept.

Nevertheless, despite strong competition, the 312T4 proved to be good enough to secure both titles. Jody Scheckter beat team-mate Villeneuve to the last drivers’ title achieved on Forghieri’s watch, and the last for the team for 21 years.

After an awful 1980 season, the team switched to turbo power for 1981 with a V6 overseen by Forghieri. Villeneuve wrestled the difficult 126CK to two famous wins in Monaco and Spain. By then Enzo Ferrari had decided that the chassis department needed some outside knowledge, and he hired Harvey Postlethwaite to design the 1982 car under Forghieri’s direction.

The 126C2 represented a huge step forward. It should have won that year’s drivers’ championship, but Villeneuve was killed at Zolder, and his team-mate Didier Pironi was badly injured at Hockenheim. The team did at least win the constructors’ title, a feat it repeated in 1983 with Rene Arnoux and Patrick Tambay driving.

By now, F1 was no longer about having one man in charge of a whole project, and Forghieri had less hands-on involvement in the later turbo machines. In 1984 he was moved sideways into road car projects, and in 1987 he finally left the company, just a year before his friend and mentor Enzo died.

Forghieri joined forces with former Ferrari team manager Daniele Audetto and worked for Chrysler-backed Lamborghini on the V12 F1 engine that would be used by the Larrousse, Lotus, Ligier and Minardi teams in 1989-93, and which was also tested at one stage by . He also had a direct involvement in the Modena team’s Lambo 291 car driven by Nicola Larini and Eric van de Poele in 1991, which rarely qualified.

He left Lamborghini that year and worked for a while on supercar projects at Bugatti, including the EB110. In 1995 co-founded Oral Engineering, an R&D and design consultancy that worked for various manufacturers, including Ferrari.

Forghieri was highly thought of by colleagues at Ferrari and only left in 1987

Current F1 team boss Mattia Binotto noted last week that Forghieri was a great motivator with a charismatic personality: “He was appointed as team manager at a young age and, with his brilliant insights, he was one of the last all-round engineers in the car world.

“I met him on various occasions and each time was something special. He was, to the end, a truly charismatic individual. His revolutionary ideas, together with his vibrant nature, abilities as a great motivator, meant he played a very important role in some of the most significant moments of Ferrari’s history and he did more than most to fuel the Prancing Horse legend. We will all miss him.”

Forghieri’s former colleague Piero Ferrari added: “We have lost a part of our history, a man who gave a great deal to Ferrari, and to the world of racing in general.”

As Red Bull and  fought at the front of the pack in both qualifying and the race,  failed to put up any kind of fight as it slumped to fifth and sixth place at the chequered flag.

led the Ferrari cars home in fifth, finishing almost a minute behind race winner  and nine seconds behind fourth-placed  despite the Mercedes driver making an extra pit stop late on to get the fastest lap bonus point.

Leclerc was a further 10 second behind in sixth to end a difficult weekend for Ferrari, which spent the first half of the season closely battling with Red Bull at the front of the pack.

“It was incredibly difficult, we were just so slow, so yeah, we need to look into it,” said Leclerc after the race.

“We were in the middle of nowhere. With Carlos, we were way slower compared to the Mercedes and Red Bull, [but] much quicker than the midfield. So we were on our own, just a very lonely race.

“There wasn't much we could have done more to be honest today.”

The race saw Mercedes draw to within 40 points of Ferrari for second place in the constructors’ championship, leaving the Italian team looking over its shoulder heading into the final two races of the season.

But Leclerc doubted Ferrari would struggle as much in Brazil or Abu Dhabi as it did in Mexico, believing it had been an outlier within its season.

“I hope we won't be worse than this, because I don't expect any race worse than this,” said Leclerc.

“It's probably one of the worst races, together with Spa, this one. I honestly believe that it is a one off.

“But for the future, we need to understand what we can do better in those conditions for us to be better.”

While Ferrari has been struggling with tyre degradation compared to Red Bull in recent races, the team found itself unable to run the power unit at maximum power due to the challenge of the altitude in Mexico City and subsequent concerns about its engine.

Ferrari F1 boss Mattia Binotto confirmed the team “didn't have the capacity to run maximum power” in Mexico, but felt there was more to explain its struggles as the car was “not comfortable with the track” all weekend.

“In terms of power unit, we were not at our best performance for the weekend, but I don't think that that's explaining the most,” he explained.

“That’s part of the equation, but there is more than that. There is certainly more than that, and it's something which we need to look at and there is not a clear answer right now.

“The ride was not great. The balance was not great. I'm pretty sure if I'm listening at the drivers later on in the debriefing, they will tell me that the car was not turning and the reason why I think it has to be looked at and we have not a clear explanation right now.”

Relative to the  and  cars,  came off third-best during qualifying at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez as Sainz could only claim fifth for Sunday's grid – as  struggled and qualified seventh behind Alfa Romeo's .

In particular, the Ferraris seemed to struggle in the high-speed Esses and there were instances where the drivers had to course correct to overcome the low-grip conditions.

Sainz conceded that the conditions had not particularly suited the Ferrari F1-75 but hoped that it would be nothing more than a “one-off” – and felt that there was more performance in the car that was left untapped.

“There was probably a bit more out there, but the car has been difficult to drive,” Sainz explained. “And normally when it's difficult, it's difficult to put laps together like we did in Austin.

“Today there was probably a couple of tenths in the bag, but for how difficult it was, I think I was extracting out there quite a lot from it. We just need to have a look, I think we've lost quite a bit of performance in high altitude, but we need to see because I think it's just a one off.

“I think it's a track that hasn't suited us very well. But we've tried to do the best we could.”

When asked how the altitude was specifically affecting the car, Sainz felt that Ferrari's powertrain was not quite as potent at dealing with the air density drop of 22 percent.

He also explained that Ferrari was struggling to switch the tyres on and left him feeling that coaxing the car through the Esses was a “fight” – but added that the team should not be too discouraged by its flying-lap tribulations.

“The altitude shouldn't affect us in terms of cornering speed,” Sainz continued. “So my guess is maybe something going on with the tyres and probably also the engine. I think altitude for this engine is not going exactly how we wanted.

“We knew before coming here we were going to need to take some compromises. And then tyres and the car, over kerbs and bumps was just difficult to drive.

“It was a fight [through the Esses]. That's why I couldn't put a lap together. We will dig deep, but at the same time we shouldn't get too discouraged.

“I think it's a very particular track, a very particular scenario, and we need to analyse what we could have done better around here and see if the race pace becomes better.”

Leclerc finished second in qualifying at Austin behind his teammate  but will drop 10 places down the order and line up 12th as a result of his team fitting a sixth internal combustion engine component and sixth turbocharger of 2022 aboard his car ahead of FP3.

That will leave Sainz starting on the front row alongside Red Bull's , who is also set to miss his teammate  as the Mexican driver too has a grid drop, five places for running a fifth ICE of the year in his RB18, which means he will start ninth.

"I'll give my best as always," Leclerc said of his Austin race ambitions after climbing from his  in qualifying parc ferme.

"Again, we're starting I think 12th or 11th with the engine penalty that we have. I'll give my best. No crazy risks but if there's an opportunity, I'll be here to take it."

A few minutes later in the post-qualifying press conference, Leclerc said he does not "know [what result will be possible from 12th], but I will try to make some places as quickly as possible in the first few laps".

He added: "[That's] so I can be in the fight and join these two guys at the front as quickly as possible."

After missing FP1 due to Robert Shwartzman driving his F1-75 as part of Ferrari's rookie practice running requirement for 2022, Leclerc was the only driver able to conduct a high-fuel race-data-gathering run in the session the teams typically devote to such exercises.

This was because most of his colleagues were dedicated solely to the Pirelli 2023 tyre test that dominated FP2 at Austin, where  and  ran a contra-run plan in their 35 minutes of 2022 tyre running that Leclerc also had to get up to speed for missing FP1.

At  and Haas, FP1 bystanders  and  were given run plans that eschewed this and concentrated solely on the 2023 tyres.

Despite Leclerc's unique Austin FP2 long-run work, Ferrari actually lacks the total data pool it had been planning to create as it was unable to do a high-fuel run on the softs in FP3 (he used the mediums early in FP2) due to an issue that confined him to the garage between qualifying simulation efforts.

When asked about this problem by Motorsport.com, Leclerc revealed it to have been "a small cut on the tyre" of the softs set he had been about to use for long running.

In that FP3 session, where the teams had to make up for the long-run time lost in FP2, Red Bull gave Verstappen only the task of running on high-fuel with the softs as Perez concentrated on qualifying runs, while Sainz provided Ferrari further long-run data on the mediums.

This means the two teams head into Sunday's race both with incomplete data sets across the two softer compounds ahead of what is expected to be a two-stop event.

But Leclerc does not think this is a particular concern for Ferrari, which has struggled for long-run pace against Red Bull since back in Austria just before the summer break.

"I don't think so," he said. "We've got this FP2 run also that nobody [else] could do just because I didn't run in FP1. I could use the mediums, which gave us a little bit of data.

"A little bit less data this morning in FP3, but all in all I don't think it will be a factor that has compromised us for the race tomorrow."

Of the decision not to complete the FP3 softs long run due to the cut tyre, Leclerc said Ferrari "didn't want to take any risks" of crashing as a result of that issue, but concluded that it was "nothing too big really".

DATE: 2022

F1 teams are bracing themselves for the  on which teams were under last year’s cost cap limit and which went over.

There was rampant speculation over the Singapore Grand Prix weekend that one team had had a minor procedural overspend, while another was well over the limits.

Aston Martin and Red Bull faced suggestions that they were the squads that could have broken the rules, but both teams moved to play down such talk – as they.

Rival teams are hugely interested in the outcome of the FIA’s audits, and especially how seriously the governing body will take any outfit that has gone over the limit.

While a 5% overspend of the circa $145 million limit is officially classified as a ‘minor’ breach,  is clear that the gains from being able to spend a few million more are huge.

Team principal Mattia Binotto admitted that it was not ideal that the 2021 championship battle was still being debated right now, but he said the significance of overspends should not be brushed under the carpet.

“It’s definitely a shame that we are talking about it in October of the following season, because at this point, apart from implications on last year’s championship, there are also implications for the current one,” he told Sky Italia.

“Let’s wait until Wednesday before making a judgement but, whatever amount we are talking about, it’s important to understand that even if it is four million, which falls into the category of what is considered a minor breach, four million is not minor.

“For us, four million represents the development parts for an entire season. Four million means 70 people in a technical department who can come up with and produce solutions that could be worth up to half a second a lap.

“So even if we are looking at something considered a minor breach it’s not peanuts.”

Mattia Binotto, Team Principal, Ferrari

He added: “We are talking of half a second and that advantage is carried forward into subsequent seasons, because while it began in 2021, it still gives a competitive advantage in 2022 and 2023, so this is clearly an important matter.

“It puts the credibility in general at stake. I hope that everyone has dealt with this exercise correctly, because otherwise it will be a very big problem to manage.”

boss Toto Wolff echoed Ferrari’s views on the significance of the upgrades, as he reckoned any extra spending had a direct impact in allowing teams to bring much more performance.

He said detailed analysis his squad had done about the car development programmes of rival teams suggested that one unnamed squad had been bringing much more than their rivals.

“Is it a so-called minor breach, because I think the word is probably not correct?” he said.

“If you're spending five million more, and you're still in the minor breach, it still has a big impact on the championship.

“To give you an idea, we obviously monitor closely which parts are being brought to the track from the top teams every single race – for the 2021 season and the 2022 season.

“We can see that there are two top teams that are just about the same and there is another team that spends more.

“We know exactly that we're spending: three and a half million a year in parts that we bring to the car. So then you can see what difference it makes to spend another $500,000. It would be a difference.

“We haven't produced lightweight parts for the car in order to bring us down from a double digit overweight because we simply haven't got the money. So we need to do it for next year's car.

“We can't homologate a lightweight chassis and bring it in, because it's two million more that we will be over the cap. So you can see every spend more has a performance advantage.”

On Wednesday the FIA will issue teams that were under the 2021 cap with their compliance certificates to confirm that they were in line with the regulations.

Any squad that is deemed to be over will then likely face a separate cost cap hearing to decide what sanctions they should face.

DATE: 2022

In the previous era of ultra-high-downforce, F1’s corresponding overtaking challenge meant teams would often focus more on setting their cars up to gain places in qualifying, knowing drivers behind would struggle to follow and wear their tyres more than a rival ahead at the same time.

The switch back to ground effect designs for 2022 has meant this phenomenon being reduced as dirty air is thrown higher and wider away from following cars, reducing extra sliding from drivers grappling with unpredictable oversteer snaps.

This has been a key factor in why ’s 10 poles to Red Bull’s five so far has nevertheless resulted in Verstappen’s squad more often than not being able to pass by in races – not including those where Ferrari’s strategy and driver blunders have gifted positions.

Ferrari’s F1-75 package has also generally been stronger on higher downforce tracks compared to Red Bull’s RB18, which led to  declaring the Scuderia to be “particularly strong around this place [Singapore]” in the pre-event press conference.

Sainz responded by saying, “if they think we’re going to be competitive, imagine what we think about how they’re going to be [as] they’ve won the last five/six races”, before suggesting the Singapore track’s layout will bring back the pole premium – as remained the case at Monaco earlier this year.

Unlike in the following street track in Baku, which has very long straights that aid overtaking, Singapore features a slew of medium speed corners with one line, while its acceleration zones are not as long.

This combination could therefore negate the improvements to F1’s overtaking show seen so far in 2022, which would encourage teams to focus more on qualifying and rely on their drivers hanging onto higher grid spots as was the case in the previous era.

Such an approach would suit Ferrari’s 2022 strength in qualifying, while at the same time alleviates pressure on its race-pace collapse against Red Bull in recent events.

“I think we can definitely bring the fight,” Sainz added, “especially in qualifying.

“It’s a track where if in the race you’re ahead you stand a bigger chance of winning the race than what we did in Spa and Monza when we were starting ahead of them.

“So, we’re going to give it our best shot – try and nail the qualifying and see what we can do in the race.”

Adding to the intrigue is Verstappen’s words to similar effect, which suggests Red Bull is so concerned about overtaking around Singapore it is primarily targeting beating Ferrari to pole – as it failed to do in Monaco.

There, rain thwarted ’s run to a likely home victory and bad weather may also be a factor teams have to consider when it comes setting up their cars for the first Singapore race since 2019.

“I do think that our car might suit it a bit better than what we have done in Monaco,” said Verstappen. “But we really need to focus over one lap.

“This year, I think we've never really been incredible over one lap. We've always been good in the race. But around here, we know that one lap performance is really important.”

When asked if Red Bull was considering sacrificing long run pace for its best potential on a qualifying flier, Verstappen said: “Yeah, I mean, you can set it up more over one lap that for a race, that's for sure.

“But on most of the tracks then in the race you will struggle a bit more around. Here, you might get away with it.”

DATE: 2022

F1 teams are bracing themselves for an  that will confirm which teams were under last year’s circa $145 million limit and which outfits went over.

The paddock at Singapore has been awash with speculation that two teams have been found to have exceeded the cap, amid suggestions one is a minor procedural breach and the other is a bigger material breach.

Fingers have been pointed at Aston Martin and Red Bull, but both teams have moved to play the situation down.

Red Bull team boss Christian Horner told Sky F1 on Friday that at the time of

However, subsequent clarifications from the FIA about areas that should and should not be included in the cost cap are understood to be central to suggestions that the squad may have been tipped over.

Late on Friday night, the FIA issued a statement insisting that its assessment of the cost cap situation was ongoing and it was too early to talk about rule breaches.

“The FIA notes significant and unsubstantiated speculation and conjecture in relation to this matter, and reiterates that the assessment is ongoing and due process will be followed without consideration to any external discussion," it said.

But while official confirmation of the situation will not come for a few days,  has urged the governing body to be especially firm, and totally open, in how it deals with the matter.

Laurent Mekies, Ferrari’s race director, told Sky Italia: “It’s now no secret that two teams broke the 2021 budget cap regulations, one by a significant amount, the other less so.

“We regard this as something very serious and we expect the FIA to manage the situation in exemplary fashion.

“We trust the FIA 100 percent. They have taken a very strong position in recent weeks and months on other issues.

“Therefore we expect that, for such a serious matter, there will be complete transparency and maximum penalties to ensure we are all racing within the same rules, because their impact on car performance is huge.”

Laurent Mekies, Racing Director, Ferrari, in the team principals Press Conference

Mekies said that beyond the significance of judgements on the individual case, how the process played out from here was vital in helping teams understand the limits of the cost cap.

“Putting penalties to one side, the important aspect is that the FIA can establish that there has been an overspend,” he said.

“Once that has been done, at least then we have confirmation that these are the rules that everyone must abide by. After that, the subject of penalties can be discussed in light of the effect of the overspend in 2021, in 2022 and what it will be in 2023, because obviously, at the current time and the point in this season in which we find ourselves, there is also an effect on next season.

“But as I mentioned, the most important thing, for which we expect the maximum severity and maximum transparency, is that the overspend is confirmed, as are the rules under which we must all race.”

Should Red Bull be found guilty of a material breach of the rules last year, then there are a range of options open to FIA as sanction – which includes fines, points deducations and goes as far as exclusion from the championship.

But with the end of the 2021 season having already been marred in controversy, it is unthinkable that the FIA would go as far as changing the results of last season’s title chase.

However, Mekies said that while such a move would be hard for many fans to accept, he said of utmost important was that teams fully respected the rules.

Asked about the implications of the breach on last year’s championship, and how it could influence both this year and next season’s campaigns, Mekies said: “We understand that it could be a problem for Formula 1 fans to have to reconsider past results.

“However, it is so very important for us to be sure that the rules are respected and are genuine rules and that if they are broken, then real penalties must be applied. [And] if not retrospectively for past infringements, then at least for the future.”

DATE: 2022

Vettel won all four of his world titles during his six-season stint at Red Bull between 2009 and 2014 before joining  for 2015.

Ferrari opted against renewing Vettel’s contract when it expired at the end of the 2020 season, paving the way for the German driver to switch to Aston Martin for the following year.

Vettel was linked with a potential return to Red Bull and it was known he had spoken to its F1 advisor, Helmut Marko. But Red Bull team principal Christian Horner .

The team ultimately turned to  - who became a free agent when Aston Martin decided to sign Vettel – when it opted to replace  at the end of the 2020 season.

Vettel was asked by Motorsport.com at Monza about the seriousness of talks with Red Bull following his Ferrari exit, but he said it was never a firm prospect.

“I made the decision to join Aston Martin before I think it was really in discussion that Alex is going to leave,” said Vettel.

“So it was never really close. But of course, I know, Christian, I know Helmut. So for sure, I had a brief chat with them, but never really anything serious.

“And I also knew that if it was, if it would have been an option or serious, we would have at least talked about it. But it never came to that point.

“So obviously, a couple of months later, you could look back and say what if, and so on. But I'm happy with the choice I made.”

Vettel will retire from F1 at the end of the season, leaving Aston Martin after two years that have seen him score its best result since rebranding for 2021 with second place in Azerbaijan last year. 2022 has proven more difficult for Aston Martin, but Vettel said there were no regrets about his decision to join the team.

“We expected that we will be more competitive last year and this year, but we were not,” said Vettel.

“I’m very happy with the way the team has progressed and [how] we are working together. So obviously it's not the dream coming true, racing in the positions we are racing, but it's been a challenge.

“I think I've accepted it and tried to make the most of it.”

Vettel has not yet confirmed any post-F1 plans besides appearing in the Race of Champions in January, and said he was currently “not considering anything” that would retain any ties to the F1 paddock, such as a non-driving role.

“Time will tell what will be something that is possible to do, if there is an offer of any such nature or not,” he said.

“Then I will see how I feel. At the moment, I’m quite happy to spend more time on other things and look forward to seeing the kids more and stuff like that.

“Then time will tell whether I get bored within three months or three years. I don't know. So we will see.”

DATE: 2022

Each F1 driver is limited to using no more than three engines per season without taking a penalty, although it is rare for anyone to get through an entire campaign on that allocation.

Many teams opted to use both Spa and Monza to take additional power unit elements, but it led to confusion over how the grid would line up due to the number of penalties that had to be applied.

team principal Binotto thought the FIA needed to clarify how the grid penalties were applied to define the starting grid more quickly, as well as considering an increase to the number of engines before penalising teams.

"The reason why it took so long [to publish the grid] is that there are certainly different interpretations and the regulation is not clear enough," said Binotto.

"That's something we need to address certainly for the future - I think not only how we decide the grid position based on the penalties, I think the amount of penalties we got as well is too many.

"[It's] difficult for a fan, I think, to see a car on pole and not start on pole because he got grid penalties. So maybe the three PUs per drivers is too little at that stage for what we have achieved.

"Maybe it needs to be reconsidered for the next seasons."

The race at Spa saw  score pole position in qualifying on Saturday, only to drop to 14th on the grid after penalties were applied.

At Monza, nine drivers took grid drops due to power unit changes, but it took the FIA a number of hours before it published the provisional starting grid.

It fuelled calls for a simplified process from the FIA to avoid such confusion - even among the drivers - and provide a quicker answer on what the starting grid would look like once qualifying had finished.

Drivers serve a 10-place grid penalty for the first time they exceed the season limit for each power unit element, and a further five-place drop for every extra usage beyond that.

Given the difficulty of overtaking at many of the upcoming circuits, most saw Spa and Monza as the best opportunity to add elements to their seasonal pool in the hope of getting to the end of the campaign without any further penalties.

DATE: 2023

Formula 1 teams are well underway preparing for the forthcoming 2025 campaign, which will consist of 24 grands prix beginning in Melbourne on the 14-16 March.

The grid is set and all but two teams -  and Aston Martin - have changed their driver line-up, meaning this year will have a new look.

But it is not just the full-time competitors that play a crucial role, as a team’s back-up driver does as well.

Reserve drivers act on standby during grand prix weekends and may contest one should a team’s regular driver be unable to. This happened at the 2024 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, for example, as .

F1 teams also employ simulator drivers, who test changes made to the car so that everybody can gain a greater understanding of the machine.

So, who are the drivers supporting their team behind the scenes for 2025?

Liam Lawson served as Red Bull’s reserve driver at the start of the 2024 season, but then .

. This means Red Bull is currently without an official reserve driver, though Lawson’s former team-mate Yuki Tsunoda is expected to step into the role.

Meanwhile, Rudy van Buren will continue as Red Bull’s simulator test and development driver after joining in 2023.

, but in a reserve driver capacity having been ’s team-mate from 2017 to 2021. The 10-time grand prix winner left for  - now  - having been replaced by George Russell, who was previously at  after graduating to F1 as a Mercedes junior.

But the Swiss outfit opted for an all-new line-up this year ahead of its Audi takeover in 2026, leaving Bottas without a drive. So, in December 2024 Mercedes announced that the Finn was back with the Silver Arrows replacing former reserve Mick Schumacher, who is part of Alpine's Hypercar programme.

Sharing the role with Bottas is the 2023 F2 championship runner-up Frederik Vesti, who started the position last year having become a Mercedes junior in 2021.

, having been part of its academy between 2015 and 2018. He initially left to become Renault’s development driver in 2019 before making his F1 debut with Alfa Romeo in 2022 but, like Bottas, he was dropped by the Hinwil-based outfit for this year.

He will work alongside , who was Zhou's predecessor at Alfa Romeo. The Italian became Ferrari’s reserve driver in 2022 and Giovinazzi also competes for the historic brand in the World Endurance Championship, where he won the 2023 Le Mans 24 Hours.

Regarding Ferrari’s development drivers, that includes Arthur Leclerc who joined in 2024. He is the younger brother of full-time Ferrari driver  and is joined by  and Davide Rigon.

McLaren is yet to announce who its reserve drivers for 2025 are, with previous incumbent . But Arrow McLaren IndyCar driver Pato O’Ward has previously contested F1 practice sessions for the Woking-based team, so it is likely he will continue his commitments.

McLaren also employs , who spends a lot of time in the team’s simulator where he works closely with the engineers and regular drivers.

Aston Martin has retained Felipe Drugovich and  as its reserve drivers for 2025. Previously the team was able to call on the reserves of engine partner Mercedes in case of an emergency but in more recent years, Aston Martin has introduced its own reserve drivers.

While Vandoorne joined from Mercedes in November 2022, Drugovich has graduated from the Aston Martin driver development programme and the 2022 F2 champion has worked with the squad since 2023.

Jack Doohan will contest his first, full campaign in F1 this year after serving as Alpine’s reserve driver in 2024 before replacing  at the Abu Dhabi season finale.

As a result, Alpine has announced Paul Aron, Ryo Hirakawa and Franco Colapinto as its reserve drivers for 2025.

Aron had a stellar F2 campaign last year, finishing third to champion Gabriel Bortoleto and Isack Hadjar, while Hirakawa has joined from McLaren where he held a similar role.

There is more hype around Colapinto though, who made his - relatively unexpected - F1 debut in Monza 2024 having replaced Logan Sargeant at . He impressed immediately finishing 12th before taking points at his second grand prix in Azerbaijan with eighth.

But Williams had already announced  as ’s team-mate for 2025, so there was no full-time seat for Colapinto. As a result, , where a spot may soon open up for the young Argentine given Doohan’s unsecure future.

Williams does not currently employ its own reserve driver, as previous incumbent Colapinto has left for the same role at Alpine after impressing for the British squad in his nine-round stint last year.

Jamie Chadwick, meanwhile, serves as its development driver after joining Williams in 2019 which is the year she clinched her first of three W Series titles.

Hadjar served as Racing Bull’s reserve driver last year, when it was known as . But following Lawson’s promotion, Hadjar will partner Tsunoda for his rookie season leaving Racing Bulls currently without an official reserve driver.

Considering its close ties with Red Bull though, the Faenza-based squad can call on whomever is in the Red Bull pool.

Zane Maloney and Theo Pourchaire have left the Sauber set-up since acting as reserve drivers last year. The Swiss outfit is yet to confirm who will support its all-new line-up of  and Bortoleto before the squad morphs into the Audi works team in 2026.

Haas is also yet to announce its reserve driver for 2025 having promoted previous incumbent Bearman to a full-time seat at the American squad. One option could be Pietro Fittipaldi though, as the grandson of double world champion Emerson joined the team in 2019 and in that time has started two races due to ’s crash at the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix.

is set for a name change in 2024 after its current title sponsorship will come to an end. The team is expected to change its name to the Sauber brand for 2024, before its transformation into the Audi works team in 2026.

Red Bull’s junior team  will also face a name change in 2024, with the team wanting to return to a non-branded name like it’s previous Toro Rosso guise. Although the rebrand is yet to be announced there is rumours the team could be called Racing Bulls.

Although there are not many massive changes heading into 2024, a new record-breaking 24 race calendar will make this the biggest year ever for the championship.

Here’s everything you need to know about the 2024 F1 season:

There are no changes to the 2023 F1 grid as we go into the new season. Every team has stuck with the drivers that they ended the season with, but many contracts set to expire at the end of 2024.

Daniel Ricciardo has also secured his place at AlphaTauri after the team axed  midway through 2023. Speculation that Sergio Perez could also lose his place at Red Bull following a difficult mid-season has been dismissed, which includes rumours that Ricciardo could be moved into the team next year.

Although the grid is not changing from the latter half of the previous season, 2024 could prove more interesting with 13 out of 20 seats up for contention at the end of next year.

F1 teams have begun to announce the dates for their 2024 car launches ahead of the new season. Pre-season testing begins on 21 February (two days earlier than 2023), so it is expected that teams will reveal their cars slightly earlier than the last season. In 2023, cars were launched between 31 January and 16 February.

Here are the F1 car launch dates for 2024:

The 2024 F1 season will begin on 29 February and will see a record-breaking 24 race season. The calendar has been regionalised by the FIA in an attempt to make the series more sustainable, including moving the Japanese GP to April from its usual September spot for a more defined Asian leg.

The Chinese GP will make its return to the F1 calendar after being cancelled for the last four years. The Qatar GP will become the penultimate race of the season, which should help with the heat issue faced by drivers in 2023 but will also make transportation of cars and equipment to the Abu Dhabi finale easier.

F1’s pre-season testing for 2024 will begin on 21 February in Bahrain. There will be three days of testing for the teams ahead of the first grand prix the following week.

The FIA has also revealed that pre-season testing will run each day between 10am to 7pm, instead of the previous 7:30pm which happened in 2023.

The testing sessions will take place in Bahrain to help with the FIA’s conscious efforts to make the series more sustainable. This means the cars and equipment will not need transporting between pre-season testing and the first grand prix of the year.

Testing will run between 10am and 7pm after the FIA reduced the timings down from 7:30pm.

The FIA has made some changes to regulations around the testing of old cars, stipulating that any components run must have been previously used at a race weekend.  has been revised to state: "Cars must only use components and software of a specification that have been used in at least one (1) Competition or TCC (testing of a current car) of a Championship season."

The regulation change will ensure that teams cannot run any brand-new components on an old car to try and gain any date outside of testing restrictions.

The F1 teams have begun to announce their 2024 reserve drivers for the upcoming season. Some of the teams have retained their 2023 reserve drivers including Red Bull rookie Liam Lawson and Mercedes’ Mick Schumacher.

However some teams have decided to bring in brand new drivers, including McLaren who have announced two new drivers to their line-up. The team has announced it will sign this year’s 24 Hours of Le Mans winner Ryo Hirakawa and IndyCar driver Pato O’Ward as reserve drivers for the next season.

DATE: 2023

Verstappen will be reportedly charged over €1.2 million to for the superlicense he needs to compete again next year.

The three-time world champion won 19 of the 22 races in 2023 which, with licenses increasing in cost for every point a driver scores, will result in a massive charge from the FIA.

Thankfully for Verstappen, the hefty fee for next year won’t be paid by himself, as he revealed: “The team pays that, fortunately.”

He told Dutch broadcaster Viaplay: “I do think there should be some normal ratio in that. But you know, things like that get written down, and I don’t think anybody expected that there would end up being that many points scored.”

Red Bull is the only team to confirm they will pay the superlicence fee for Verstappen and it is not known whether his team-mate  or other drivers will have to pay their own fees.

Verstappen finished the season with 575 points in 2023, which is the most points ever secured by a driver in a season. However, Verstappen’s dominance has left the driver with an eye-watering cost to ensure he can drive next year.

The Dutchman had previously branded the costs as “absurd” where he added: “I don’t think it’s right that we have to pay so much. It’s not the case in other sports either. And there are more and more races.”

Fortunately for Red Bull the driver salaries and fees are not included in the FIA’s budget cap which ensures teams limit spending and gives a more level playing field to each team.

Team principal Christian Horner also told Viaplay: “I mean, it’s a luxury problem to have because we’ve had to score the points to generate the invoice. Thankfully, it’s outside of the budget cap. But yeah, it’s a big cheque to be writing to the FIA.”

An FIA superlicence is the highest type of licence available and is a mandatory requirement by any driver who wants to compete in Formula 1. The licence is awarded to drivers by the F1 governing body, the FIA.

The superlicence was first introduced in the 1990s, but a governing age was added in 2015, following Verstappen’s debut in 2015. Verstappen was 17 years and 166 days old when he first made his F1 debut, with the FIA adding the rule to prevent potentially unsafe and inexperienced drivers from competing.

Drivers must complete a series of requirements to be rewarded their superlicence, including being at least 18 years old when they would first compete in F1, hold a valid driving licence and pass an FIA theory test of the F1 sporting codes and regulations.

Those who have held a superlicence for the previous three seasons are still eligible to apply for a new one if they plan to make their return to F1. This means that drivers such as , who was dropped from  in the first half of the 2023 season, could reapply for their superlicence and make his F1 return in the next few years.

The mandatory superlicence reportedly consists of a €10,400 base figure that every driver must pay to ensure they can compete in the following season. There is also a reported additional charge of €2,100 for every point scored in the season that has just passed.

Verstappen secured 575 points in the 2023 season which comes with a staggering additional cost to the drivers superlicence, with each point achieved costing the driver an additional €2,100. Having scored 575 points in 2023, Verstappen’s licence fee is sat at €1,217,900.

Here’s the full list of how much each driver will reportedly have to pay for their 2024 superlicence:

According to these numbers, the total figure that the FIA will receive from F1’s drivers in 2024, to allow them to race, is €5,380,200.

DATE: 2023

Last week  between a team principal and FOM employee, amid dubious allegations that  boss Toto Wolff and his wife Susie, who runs the F1 Academy for FOM, had exchanged confidential information.

Less than 48 hours later the matter was dropped as the FIA  to prevent unauthorised disclosure of confidential information, but , who said they had their reputation harmed by the public nature of the probe.

Wolff's  counterpart Vasseur feels the whole saga was “quite embarrassing” and unnecessary as the FIA managed to clear the Wolffs shortly after going public with the probe, which suggests there was no need to issue a public statement in the first place.

“I think this story is quite embarrassing for our sport,” Vasseur said when asked by Motorsport.com if he was worried by the incident and its implications on the already frosty relationship between FOM and the FIA.

“The story started with an article in a newspaper, I don't know if newspaper is the right word. And I think in this situation when you are speaking about an individual, you have to take care of what you are saying.

“I think it would have been appropriate from the FIA; they needed 24 hours between the [first] announcement and the second announcement. It would have made sense to use the 24 hours before the first announcement [to investigate], to avoid any bad conclusions."

The probe was launched amid suggestions that rival teams had complained about the Wolffs to the FIA, but one day later  and denying they were behind the probe.

Vasseur pointed out that if anything good had come from the whole saga, it was that all 10 teams were united on a certain topic, which is a rare occurrence in F1.

“After the 'incident' of last week at least the teams were very united,” he added. “The first conclusion for me is that we were able to act together and it's not very often that even  was supportive of Toto! [Vasseur laughs]

“And honestly, I think it's a good point for us also to take position and to discuss with the other stakeholders. I think it's the first time the teams together showed something like this.”

out-qualified  team-mate  yet again in the season finale, which meant the 27-year-old finished the F1 season as the only driver to have out-qualified his team-mate for every race in 2023.

Sargeant struggled in his rookie campaign with Albon always proving superior, but other driver pairings were much closer. So how did each driver compare to their team-mate in the 2023 F1 season?

Arguably one of the most one-sided pairings in 2023 was Red Bull, as Verstappen proved too much for Perez. The triple world champion clinched the title with six grands prix to spare and set many records in doing so.

One record was for the biggest points gap to second in the championship, with the margin bigger than the total points Perez amassed across 2023. While Verstappen was consistently claiming the race wins, Perez often struggled for a podium finish despite Red Bull’s superiority over the rest of the grid.

Perez did start the season pretty well with two victories in the opening four races, as well as second in Bahrain. But from Miami onwards, Verstappen took it to another level leaving Perez to struggle and doubts to linger over his Red Bull future.

The pressure is on the Mexican to improve significantly in 2024, which is the final year of his contract.

Hamilton bounced back from a disappointing 2022 where Russell, in his first season at Mercedes, beat him in the standings and became the third team-mate of the seven-time world champion - after  (2011) and  (2016) - to do so.

But the roles reversed in 2023 and Russell said “this year the drivers’ championship has just been a complete disaster”. Hamilton, meanwhile, was one of F1’s best, being the highest-placed driver behind Red Bull’s pair in the standings with a pole position in Hungary his standout result.

Nevertheless, on the whole it has been a disappointing season for Mercedes who failed to claim a race victory for the first time since 2011. Much work is to be done if they are to improve on their second-place finish from 2023 and become world champions once again.

Crucial to that target is the drivers, who remain committed to the project having recently signed new contracts. Hamilton and Russell have a good relationship with much respect between the two, despite their collision in Qatar where the 38-year-old retired on lap one after turning in on his team-mate at the opening corner.

Leclerc and Sainz have been team-mates for three seasons now, yet it’s always close between the two. 2023 was a clear example of that as just six points separated both drivers in the championship going in the favour of Leclerc, but Sainz might be the happier one as it’s him who got the race victory.

Meanwhile, Leclerc often has the upper hand in qualifying, winning that battle 15-7 - including five pole positions compared to Sainz’s two. Things might be tight, yet 2023 was not their closest statistically as Sainz beat Leclerc in the 2021 championship by just five and a half points.

Norris comfortably beat former team-mate  in the championship for two consecutive years, so McLaren wanted closer competition in 2023. Piastri gave it exactly that as he impressed in his rookie season which earned the 22-year-old a new contract that expires in 2026.

While the head-to-heads ended at 17-5 and 15-7 to Norris in the grand prix and qualifying battles respectively, much of that was at the beginning of the year when Piastri was still trying to adapt to F1. Once he did, things were much closer.

Piastri out-qualified Norris in five of the 10 grands prix after the summer break, which included a victory in the Qatar GP sprint race, while a win of any kind in F1 still eludes the Briton.

was a much-improved team in 2023 as they jumped up to fifth in the championship after finishing seventh in 2022. This included eight podiums and three front-row starts, yet that was all done by Alonso who dominated team-mate Stroll.

While Alonso was often fighting for podium positions, Stroll was in the midfield, with the Canadian only achieving three top-five finishes - two of which came in the final three grands prix. But his seat is still secure for 2024 where he will hope to close the gap on Alonso.

Aston Martin also need to ensure its results remain consistent throughout a season. Its form tailed off towards the end of 2023 as six of Alonso’s podiums came in the opening eight grands prix, which left Aston Martin third in the constructors’ championship until they fell behind Ferrari and McLaren in the final 14 rounds.

There was very little to separate the Alpine team-mates in Gasly’s first season with the team, but Ocon could blame that on misfortune. He retired more times than any other F1 driver in 2023, much of which was down to reliability - his failed gearbox in Singapore being just one example.

This led to the drivers being matched head-to-head in race results, but Gasly comfortably beat Ocon in the qualifying battle. That might give Gasly extra satisfaction considering it’s against Ocon, who has been his rival since childhood.

There was much anticipation at the beginning of 2023 over how the two will fare as team-mates given their history - the two often collided when competing against each other as children in karting - but on the whole Ocon and Gasly have worked well together and things have not flared up.

That’s despite it being a disappointing season for Alpine, who finished sixth - two places lower than their position in 2022.

Williams very much had the most one-sided driver pairing in 2023. Albon really impressed this season with several point finishes and Q3 appearances, therefore showing why he is capable of leading the team forward.

Yet it was a different story in the opposite side of his garage. Sargeant struggled during his rookie season which is evident in the qualifying record versus Albon, while only beating him in three grands prix. However, those three occasions were because Albon retired so in races where both drivers finished the Thai-British driver was always ahead.

Sargeant did score a point, but it only came as a result of Hamilton and Leclerc being disqualified from the United States GP. Despite the struggles, Williams has retained Sargeant for 2024 so he should do much better in his sophomore year.

The team-mate battle at AlphaTauri is very messy given how many times the team changed its line-up in 2023. Beginning the season was Tsunoda and de Vries until the F1 rookie was dropped after 10 grands prix for poor performances.

De Vries left AlphaTauri having failed to score a point while at the time, Tsunoda had two. The 23-year-old comfortably won the qualifying battle as well, as de Vries struggled throughout his tenure with six bottom-five finishes including two retirements.

Ricciardo replaced de Vries for the Hungarian GP, which marked his return to F1 after leaving McLaren at the end of 2022. Ricciardo immediately had the better of Tsunoda by beating him in qualifying and the race at the Hungaroring, but the Japanese driver levelled both scores a week later in Belgium.

Yet Ricciardo then spent a lengthy time on the sideline, as he broke his hand during second practice for the Dutch GP. He returned two months later at the United States GP where things were once again tight between Ricciardo and Tsunoda.

In the final five grands prix, Tsunoda out-qualified and out-raced his team-mate on three occasions while scoring 15 points compared to Ricciardo's six. The two will remain team-mates in 2024, where there’s potentially a shot at a Red Bull seat for the following season.

While Ricciardo was injured, Red Bull junior Lawson stepped in to become Tsunoda’s third team-mate of 2023. Lawson, who finished third in the 2022 F2 Championship, immediately impressed coming close to points in Zandvoort and Monza before a ninth-place finish at the Singapore GP after he pulled off a shock Q3 appearance at Marina Bay Street Circuit.

Lawson then finished 11th in Japan, but was well out of contention in Qatar for his final grand prix. In terms of race results, he performed better than Tsunoda and was therefore touted for an F1 seat in 2024 but that did not present itself. Lawson will be the team’s reserve driver next year, but the expectation is that he will eventually be on the grid full-time.

Hulkenberg made his return to F1 in 2023 after losing his full-time seat with Renault at the end of 2019. Yet it was like he’d never been away as he beat team-mate Magnussen in the championship, while winning both race and qualifying battles quite comfortably.

That driver pairing was one to watch in 2023 due to their history together, where at the 2017 Hungarian GP Hulkenberg called Magnussen “the most unsporting driver on the grid” after being pushed off the track while attempting an overtake.

However, there was very little drama between the two in their first year as team-mates and they actually worked pretty well together. Hulkenberg and Magnussen have been retained by Haas for 2024, but they will be hoping for a more competitive car after the team finished bottom of the championship.

finished third in the standings with fewer than half the points of champion Red Bull. But Sainz thinks Ferrari can use the off-season to erase that gap for 2024 based on the example set by , which overcame a torrid start to 2023 to become the second-fastest team.

Asked about the prospects of challenging Red Bull from the off, Sainz replied: "I think it has to be our realistic aim. Yes. Will we manage to do it? Only time will time.

"I want the team to be thinking that it is possible because I believe it is. Also, we've proven that if McLaren has been able to do these steps during the season, I'm perfectly confident that Ferrari can do it over a winter break."

McLaren failed to score a point in the opening two races in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia but following a three-stage upgrade that transformed the aerodynamics of the MCL60, its drivers went on to bag nine podiums, plus rookie  won the Qatar sprint race.

Since the SF-23 proved strong in qualifying, as shown by Sainz and team-mate  scoring seven pole positions, the Spaniard reckons the Scuderia needs to focus on making the car into an "all-rounder".

Underlining his faith in the designers to "turn things around", he continued: "I trust this team. I trust the capacity that we have back at home to turn things around.

"There are still circuits where we are on pole by 0.3 seconds to the Red Bull. It's just that it's a very specific trait of the car that really is good. We just need to make it an all-rounder."

Singapore winner Sainz reckons the 2024 car already feels different in the simulator compared to its predecessor, which he praised for its top speed, braking and short-corner behaviour.

But he added that Ferrari must not be afraid to sacrifice these traits to take a bigger step forward overall: "The car has very, very strong points. But I feel like if we want to have a car for the whole year, maybe we need to give away some of these traits to make sure that we're quick everywhere, especially in the race.

"I think it's in the races where we need to really focus on understanding what are we doing to this car."

The 2023 F1 season witnessed mega dominance by  who continued its fine form from 2022, while many other teams had vastly different campaigns to the year before.

and  both moved up the championship order quite significantly, while  and  dropped down.

But many others were up and down, too. So how did each F1 team perform in the 2023 season compared to 2022 and were there any shocks on the grid?

*Wins, pole positions and podiums don’t include sprint races

Red Bull had a truly dominant 2022 season where it clinched the constructors’ championship with three rounds left, while  won a record-breaking 15 grands prix in a year. Considering such success, the question was how could Red Bull improve for 2023 - but that was something they managed to do.

The RB19 broke several records which arguably makes it the most dominant car in F1 history, where 21 grands prix wins helped Red Bull score over double the points tally of its runner-up .

Key to Red Bull’s dominance was once again Verstappen, who broke his own record for most wins in a season (19) plus many others to clinch a third consecutive drivers’ title.

Mercedes ended 2022 with big disappointment, as the Silver Arrows got its narrow sidepod design significantly wrong and saw a run of eight consecutive championships ended by Red Bull. But, statistically, 2023 was even worse despite Mercedes adding wider sidepods onto its car for Monaco, which was the season’s sixth round.

The team had its first winless campaign since 2011 while scoring less than half of their podium tally from 2022. Mercedes often struggled to find the ideal operating window for its car during a weekend with set-up sometimes changing from session to session.

However, there was still a positive moment as  took pole for the Hungarian Grand Prix during a year where the seven-time world champion delivered impressive performances en route to third in the championship, despite his car’s struggles.

It was a different story for team-mate , who finished eighth in the drivers’ standings with just two of the team’s eight podiums to his name.

Ferrari had a season to forget as it slipped to third in the championship scoring 148 points less than 2022. The Scuderia’s biggest struggle was excessive tyre wear and inconsistent race pace which left them 454 points behind world champions Red Bull.

This was made worse as they arguably started 2022 with the quickest car, as Ferrari began that year with a 1-2 in Bahrain and led the Austrian squad by 49 points after three races.

Since the Australian GP in April 2022 though, Ferrari has won just three grands prix and look very far from any kind of title challenge:  finished fifth in the drivers’ standings, while , whose win in Singapore was the only non-Red Bull victory of 2023, came seventh.

The turnaround McLaren had in 2023 was remarkable. It started the year as a backmarker with no points in the opening two races, but wholesale updates for the grands prix in July turned their fortunes around. What it caused was nine podiums, plus a sprint race victory, in the latter half of the 2023 season, which lifted McLaren up to fourth in the championship from sixth before the upgrades.

Another reason for McLaren’s revival was that it finally had both cars consistently fighting for higher positions. Rookie  replaced the struggling , who rarely challenged  in their two years as team-mates.

Norris scored 77% of McLaren’s points in 2022, which dropped to 68% in 2023 and helped them to challenge the likes of Ferrari and Mercedes - sometimes Red Bull even.

Aston Martin was one of the surprise packages in 2023, as it already surpassed its 2022 points tally after three grands prix. The British outfit started the season with the second-quickest car, as  consistently stood on the podium alongside both Red Bull drivers.

This came after very aggressive developments over the winter, which resulted in the AMR23 being 2.4 seconds quicker than its predecessor in the first qualifying session of the season. However, other teams eventually caught up and overtook Aston Martin in the championship as it brought limited upgrades to the car, scoring just two podiums in the final 14 grands prix.

Nevertheless, it was a remarkable turnaround from 2022 when Aston Martin started that year without a point in the opening three races and its best result was sixth in Azerbaijan, Singapore and Japan.

Alpine had an underwhelming 2023, dropping two positions in the championship and scoring 53 fewer points. A large reason for this was the inconsistent A523 car which usually suffered at high-speed and low-downforce circuits, while reliability was often a problem with  retiring from six grands prix. The management turmoil did not help matters either, as Laurent Rossi, Otmar Szafnauer and Alan Permane all left midway through the season.

But there were some positive moments for the French outfit, who scored two podiums with its new driver line-up. Ocon claimed third in Monaco, while  achieved the same result in Zandvoort en route to the drivers finishing 11th and 12th in the standings.

So, it was a very up-and-down season for Alpine who finished a very comfortable sixth and showed much less consistency than 2022 where the team scored points in all but three grands prix.

Williams was one of the most improved teams in 2023 as the British outfit achieved its highest finishing position since 2017, after coming last in four of the following five seasons. Key to Williams’ improvement was its frightening straight-line speed where  topped the speed trap in Canada at 213.1mph.

The 27-year-old had a terrific season, finishing 13th in the championship – six places higher than 2022 – with 27 points, yet team-mate  struggled. The rookie scored just one point, which came because Leclerc and Hamilton were both disqualified from the United States GP, but Sargeant has still been retained for 2024.

A new team principal in James Vowles was also behind Williams’ improved form, and the team now look in good stead to build on their seventh-place finish rather than dropping back down to last.

AlphaTauri improved significantly towards the end of 2023 thanks to a largely updated package. The Italian outfit scored 22 of their 25 points after the summer break, which caused AlphaTauri to rise from bottom to eighth in the constructors’ championship and bring it closer to its 2022 total.

A factor behind this was the improved performances of , who beat his 2022 points tally (12) by five, climbed three positions in the standings to come 14th and showed much greater consistency in his fight for a top-10 finish.

The 23-year-old adopted more of a team leader role following the departure of Gasly, while the seat alongside him was never quite settled with Tsunoda having three separate team-mates across 2023.

Alfa Romeo started the ground effect era with much promise as it scored a double points finish in the 2022 season-opening Bahrain GP. That contributed to a points tally of 51 in the opening nine grands prix before scoring just four in the following 13, as Alfa was slow on upgrades in the latter half of 2022.

Unfortunately for the team it has struggled to rediscover its form from the start of that season as the Swiss outfit scored just 16 points across 2023. It happened because the team failed to meet targets they set for the season, meaning Alfa was largely playing catch-up when it came to upgrades.

It resulted in  finishing 15th in the drivers’ championship, five places lower than 2022, while Zhou Guanyu came 18th in both seasons.

Much like Alfa Romeo, Haas began the ground effect era with plenty to be positive about. The American squad started 2022 with points in three of the opening four races after starting development on its VF-22 much earlier than others.

Haas finished the year eighth in the championship, which included a shock pole position for  in rain-hit Brazil, but things were much different in 2023. Its car really struggled with the overheating of tyres meaning Haas had a big disadvantage in races.

Despite solid efforts from its drivers  - who returned to F1 for 2023 - and Magnussen, Haas claimed just four points finishes in the season which left them bottom of the standings.

DATE: 2023

arrived at the start of 2023 with an evolution of the 2022 car that challenged Red Bull at the start of last season but then faded away.

The SF-23 again proved promising over one lap but struggled from wild aerodynamic inconsistencies that made it struggle over a race stint, especially on hot, high-downforce circuits.

Ferrari embarked on an aggressive development project in Maranello, but while it added aerodynamic load and mitigated some of its weaknesses through a range of updates, it failed to fully get on top of its race pace issues.

Chassis chief Cardile explained the team soon found the SF-23's chassis a limiting factor of much more it could achieve.

"The 2023 car has been developed in continuity with the 2022 car, trying to improve some limitations of the previous car," Cardile told select media, including Motorsport.com.

"All in all, our goal has been achieved because the car on track behaved exactly how it has been developed.

"The problem was that soon we realised that the direction we took was not the most profitable, so we reviewed internally our targets for the aero development. The first step has been with the spring package, where we changed the floor and bodywork, followed by another step in Austria.

"But then we reached the limitations of the architecture or what we were able to do with the chassis."

Under the cost cap introducing a B-spec chassis during the season is not feasible, so a team's initial chassis design as well as other packaging choices limit the extent to which it can re-develop.

For Ferrari, these constraints were mainly related to the sidepods, with its decision to place the lower of the mandatory side impact spars as high as it could coming back to bite it.

"The limitations were mainly on the chassis, because the main difference between our car and the Red Bull style car was under the radiator inlet and the pod design, ours was fatter than the Red Bull one," Cardile explained.

"The reason why is because we were using this portion of the bodywork to pressurise the area in front to control the tyre wake. On the other hand, digging below the radiator inlet we can promote a better flow towards the rear end of the car, benefiting in terms of the rear load but then we have to recover the tyre wake control somewhere else.

"By having this 'fatter' pod we didn't need to design a very 3D shape in the chassis because we put the electronics just below the radiators. And the Side Impact Structure (SIS), the lower one we put on the maximum height allowed by the regulations because we found performance cleaning the top surface of the front floor.

"Once you decide that to achieve a different target you need different shapes, these two facts, the position of the electronics and the design of the chassis, and this lower SIS position quickly became a constraint.

"In our case that would have implied a new chassis and a new gearbox, basically a brand new car, which is not achievable during the season for many reasons."

Behind the dominant Red Bull RB19, which appeared to work in all conditions and corner types, most other teams found the operating window of their cars extremely limited, which induced some wild fluctuations in form.

Across 2023 Ferrari, , Aston Martin and  all had the second-fastest car at various points while struggling on other weekends.

Cardile believes Ferrari's well-documented inconsistencies and tyre wear struggles were largely the result of its aerodynamics, playing down the influence of its suspension design.

That aero map also dictated how sensitive the Ferrari SF-23 was to yaw, which particularly affected the confidence of its drivers  and  in windy conditions.

"We think we know why our performance degrades in the race and for us, it's related to how the aero map is made and the peak downforce we can have," he explained.

"Suspension set-up to me is a bit overrated because, at the end of the day, you design the suspension to gain aero and at the same time have reasonable kinematics.

Charles Leclerc, Ferrari SF-23

"The problem with tyre wear is how the car operates, and how the car operates is absolutely ruled by the aero behaviour of the car. So, everything is down to aero unless the suspension design is massively wrong."

As its 2023 chassis design was not compatible with the aerodynamic direction it wanted to pursue, the team shifted focus to its 2024 car relatively early, which is set to be a full re-design. Instead of bringing massive updates, it began experimenting more with its set-up choices after the summer break to accelerate that learning for next year.

"Next year's car will turn the page," added Cardile. "We kept the target that we set ourselves but we understood that to achieve this target we need different contents on the car. So, next year's car has been designed differently from the 2022 one."

Ferrari's goal for 2024, then, is not only to develop a car with better peak performance, but one whose performance is less 'fragile' and doesn't just work well in specific circumstances, such as in Singapore where Sainz kept Red Bull from a clean sweep of race wins.

"The peak performance is probably not miles away from Red Bull, but we need the full commitment of the driver, we need the right ambient conditions, we need the right combination of corners," Cardile summed up.

"We need a lot of stuff which makes the performance difficult to repeat during the race stint, when the tyres start to give up and the balance of the car changes. The impression we have is that the Red Bull's platform is more robust than ours.

"Red Bull is demonstrating that it's not impossible [to have a car that performs everywhere]. It's just a matter of hard work with the right targets."

The Scuderia narrowly missed out on second in the constructors’ standings by three points to  but collected fewer than half the points of runaway title winner Red Bull.

While the 2023 car could compete in qualifying, with Sainz and  notching seven pole positions, race pace was lacking.

It also suffered from an unstable rear end, which the team sought to solve by moving the set-up towards understeer. This particularly hurt Leclerc.

As  develops a new concept for the 2024 season, Sainz reckons the car model already feels different to drive in the team simulator. Asked about the progress, he said: “I think we're going to need to wait until testing. I think it's incredibly difficult to know.

“The car in the simulator is behaving differently, for sure. But I think until we put the car in 100 kilos [race fuel] and used tyres, it's going to be impossible to see how the car is actually treating the tyres, treating the pace and how our race pace is going to be affected.

Carlos Sainz, Ferrari SF-23

“That we will only know in Bahrain [testing] when we put it on track. In the meantime, we can just focus on adding performance to that car in the wind tunnel and trying to make it better.”

Sainz says Ferrari must be willing to sacrifice the strengths of the SF-23 - he picked out straight-line speed, braking, short-corner performance and an ability to ride the kerbs as it main assets - should it get the team closer to Red Bull.

As part of this, the Singapore Grand Prix victor reckoned Ferrari is now focusing heavily on unlocking consistency to iron out the fluctuating form that typified its 2023 campaign.

He continued: “We understood it and now we just put it on track and we try to maximise it every weekend. I think we are doing a much better job of that.

“It's almost unbelievable that these swings in performance can happen. But it is the Formula 1 of nowadays.

“Now we need to focus on making sure… we understand why the car there is strong and why so weak in other types of circuits and corners.”

brought a new floor to Suzuka in September in a bid to improve its aerodynamic efficiency. The revamp featured changes to the front floor fences, floor edge, mid floor and diffuser sidewall, which worked in unison with a revised sidepod undercut.

The Scuderia's efforts to reduce drag also allowed Leclerc to be more comfortable in the SF-23, after team-mate  had taken over from the Monegasque as the team's lead driver after the summer break.

While the update itself wasn't worth a huge amount of laptime, it allowed Leclerc to lean on the car harder, which saw him regain the upper hand on Sainz with three podiums and three pole positions across the final five race weekends.

“We had a small upgrade in Japan and I don’t know in terms of pure performance if it was something bigger, but I think in terms of comfort it was important and very beneficial for Charles," Vasseur said.

"I think Charles was in a much better shape in the last part of the season, the last six or seven races. This was a positive dynamic. I think we did a step a bit later on the consistency and the fact that we improved the car a little bit. That way we were able to be more consistent or have to push less in the race."

But as the battle behind Red Bull was decided by tenths, with Ferrari narrowly losing out to  in the fight for second, Vasseur didn't want to overstate the performance swings between his two drivers or indeed the rest of the frontrunners.

"Sometimes it is a matter of details. At the end of the day we are speaking about tenths of seconds, and from one weekend to the other we have to accept that they are sportsmen," he explained.

"[Roger] Federer can win one day in Wimbledon and lose the next, so I am taking them always as sportsman, up and down.

"What is true in our business today is that if you have a look at five years ago the Mercedes guys could miss one corner and still be on pole position. That is not the case today, you miss one corner, you are out in Q1.

"If you look at the two McLarens, they were out in Q1 [in Las Vegas] and they were able to fight for pole [in Abu Dhabi]. This is true for everybody except Max [Verstappen] probably, but it is true for Checo [Perez] and it means that we don’t have to draw too big a conclusion after one change."

DATE: 2023

The  driver tangled with  at the second race restart of a chaotic Australian GP, sending his fellow Spaniard into the wall at Turn 2 before the third red flag.

Amid the FIA's final restart decisions, Sainz lined up for the final lap in fourth but was given a five-second penalty for the incident, so when the race ended under safety car conditions he was relegated to 12th when the penalty was applied.

An angry Sainz wished to review the penalty with the stewards, stating over team radio: "No, this is unacceptable! They need to wait until the end of the race to discuss with me."

Sainz later felt he needed to see the stewards to talk through the incident and penalty before giving his full take on it.

"I think it is the most unfair penalty I've ever seen in my life," he said after the Albert Park race.

"Before talking to you and saying any really bad stuff or bad words, I'd prefer to go back to the stewards, have a conversation with them and maybe I can come back and talk again.

"Because right now honestly I cannot do it, I think it is too unfair and I don't feel well to speak."

Ferrari team boss Fred Vasseur agreed with his driver and felt the stewards were too hasty, given the call wouldn't have impacted the podium result.

At the last race in Saudi Arabia, the stewards came under pressure for handing Alonso a post-race penalty which changed the order, promoting  onto the rostrum after the podium ceremony – only for the penalty to be reversed on review.

"My frustration is more that they took a decision before the end, before they listen, with one lap behind the safety car," he said.

"It would've made sense to wait for the hearings and discuss exactly what they thought and what they see. It wasn't going to change the podium at all, it was not a drama."

Sainz was also handed two penalty points on his license after the stewards found he was "wholly to blame for the collision".

"Car 14 was significantly ahead of Car 55 at the first corner and nevertheless Car 55 drove into Car 14, causing it to spin and leave the track," stated the stewards' document.

"For avoidance of doubt, we took into account the fact that this collision took place at the first lap of the restart, when, by convention, the Stewards would typically take a more lenient view of incidents.

"However, in this particular case, notwithstanding the fact that it was the equivalent of a first lap incident, we considered that there was sufficient gap for Car 55 to take steps to avoid the collision and failed to do so."

Sainz's penalty left Ferrari without any points from the weekend. Team-mate  went off on the opening lap after clashing with the other Aston Martin of  at Turn 3, which was judged as a racing incident.

The result leaves the Italian manufacturer trailing in fourth place in the F1 world constructors' championship, and already 97 points behind leaders Red Bull after three races.

DATE: 2023

The Italian team took the covers off its SF-23 challenger at its Fiorano track on Tuesday as part of a launch occasion that was open to invited media and a grandstand full of  fans.

After a short series of interviews with Sainz, his teammate  and new team principal Frederic Vasseur, Ferrari completed the SF-23’s initial laps – with Leclerc driving for two tours before handing over to Sainz.

Although the runs were very short and had to be completed on demonstration Pirelli tyres with the drivers unable to fully push, such a move was still a risk to conduct in public given the early stages of preparations for the coming campaign and the possibility of an early reliability issue – not uncommon on F1 cars not long built – occurring.

But it stood at odds with 2023 launch events conducted by other F1 squads – some of which, such as Red Bull’s season launch, did not even feature 2023 cars on display.

“I think it was honestly amazing,” Sainz said of his first experience of the SF-23.

“And I think as Ferrari, today I’m going to allow myself to give a bit of praise to the team and what they organised because I think [it] factor in their influence today.

“I think Formula 1 needs these kinds of events nowadays, these kind of presentations where you bring all the media, to bring the fans, to bring our partners, to bring the engineers that are involved in the project, you bring the mechanics that have been working on the car for the last couple of months – you join them all together and you do a proper presentation with the car running.

“Where you see the actual Formula 1 car running without too much privacy, [all] enjoying the nature of Formula 1.

“And I think we were brave as a team to do it because it’s the first ever installation lap that we did with that car and it can always go bad.

“But we took the risk just to do something a bit different and I hope that you guys enjoyed it – because I definitely did and it was a very good day for the team, for Ferrari and F1."

When asked if he felt it had been a positive off-season for Ferrari after its ultimately disappointing 2022 campaign, Sainz again moved to praise its extensive public launch.

“Yeah, the first thing that I’m positive about is everything that we did today, nothing went wrong, everything went perfect,” he explained.

“It’s actually, as I said before, relatively high risk to put a brand new F1 car on track in front of so many people and to actually get to enjoy it without any single problem on track – normally in these installation laps there’s always different issues here and there and today the car was running smoothly.

“I could actually push a bit on it and lean a bit in the car in the corners and feel the first things. And we’ve already given some feedback to the engineers to work on for tomorrow.

“Tomorrow we have the famous 100km [filming day permitted in F1’s rules] where will continue to do the build up to Bahrain.

“Obviously, until Bahrain we will not know how the car is performing and how the car is handling, but at least we’ve already covered some nice steps in the right direction.”

failed to win at the start of the second ground-effects F1 era last year, with Norris achieving a sole team podium in the Emilia Romagna GP.

The struggles with its MCL36 left the Woking outfit to take its first major competitive backwards step since the start of its Andreas Seidl-led recovery plan.

From scoring third in the 2020 constructors’ championship, McLaren fell to fifth behind  while it waits for its new simulator and wind tunnel to be completed.

In an exclusive interview with Motorsport.com, Norris reckons his team must match 2022 runner-up and four-time GP winner ’s gains over one winter.

He said: "That's achievable. I think what they did was extremely good.

“Going from where they were [in 2021], from almost getting beat by us, to going to where they are getting wins, fighting for podiums every single weekend…That's what we need to be aiming for.

“That level of a jump from one season to another.

“They've obviously had, not the luck, but they've maximised a new era, a new rules set for Formula 1 with new cars, which has allowed them to make a bigger jump than ever.

“But there's still plenty of opportunities for us to achieve something like that.

“And that's where we need to be setting our goals for.”

Norris, 23, added that he did not want to have to wait for the new wind tunnel - which is unlikely to impact car performance until 2024 - for the team to notably improve.

He instead reckoned the team can make much better use of its current resources.

He added: “The fact is, we have to do a better job and the team have to do a better job with making a better car.

“I think already next year we need to make progress. I have good faith that we can.

“We have a huge amount of what we need in the right areas and the right people and so on.

“It's just that final hurdle, the final thing to get us up to the same level to then have no excuse against Red Bull, , and Ferrari.

“The team know that they need to do a better job.”

While Norris is contracted to McLaren until the end of 2025, he concedes that his impatience to win has been exacerbated by ex-team-mate  and 2018 FIA F2 title rival  making potentially career-defining switches to Ferrari and Mercedes to win races.

Norris continued: “I wish I was there with them. Of course, I wish I was in that battle.

“I feel like I deserve to be in that battle. I feel like I can be, and I think it will be a great battle.

“But it's just not the position that I'm in at the minute... I can race against them in the future, and I can do the same as what they're doing. “

Red Bull completed its first double championship win since 2013 last year as  clinched his second drivers’ title with four races to spare, which the team followed by sealing the constructors’ crown at the next round in the USA.

Verstappen won a record 15 races through 2022, while Red Bull set a new record for the number of points scored by a team through a single season.

But as Red Bull prepares to defend its titles this year, the team has to contend with an additional limit on its aerodynamic testing as punishment for breaching the budget cap in 2021.

It was already set to receive the least amount of time in the wind tunnel as a result of its championship win, but was hit with a further 10% drop for the breach, along with a $7 million fine.

“The reduction in wind tunnel testing means we can therefore evaluate less different components, less different ideas,” explained Newey, Red Bull’s chief technical officer.

“If we’re really smart and always putting the right things on the model, then of course it doesn’t make much difference.

“Ferrari won’t be resting, they’ll be sorting out their weak areas. They had a couple of reliability problems. They made a couple of pit wall mistakes. So they’ll be right back.

“And then of course, you saw Mercedes starting with a car that was quite a long way off the pace, and evolving it to the point that it won the last race but one.

“You know they will be right there. So it’s going to be a tough year, for sure.”

Although Mercedes made significant progress with its car through the second half of the season after struggling in the early part of the year, Red Bull remained the dominant team, winning 10 of the final 11 races.

The Red Bull RB18 was recognised for its success by winning the International Racing Car of the Year Award at the  in December.

Newey said that Red Bull could be “very proud” of what it achieved with the RB18, saying it focused on ensuring there was decent scope for development - something evident as it pulled clear of Ferrari through the second half of the year.

“We focused on trying to get the fundamentals right, trying to get the package in the way that would include suspension, front and rear suspension, the layout of the monocoque, the layout of the radiators and so forth,” said Newey.

“It was so that we would have the package that hopefully, even if it didn’t start out as the quickest car, we could develop through the season.

“In pre-season testing, we were a little bit worried before we got there, so we’d already done a lot of research and knew roughly what we needed to do to improve it.

“When we put the race one package on in Bahrain, just before the race, then that catapulted us from definitely behind Ferrari to broadly level, let’s say.

“The car definitely had some weaknesses in the first half of the season. We still have some weaknesses of course. But we reduced those weaknesses, and certainly by the second half, then we had a fully competitive package.”

Describing 2024 as a "character-building year," Carlos Sainz discussed the emotions that ran through him following his appendicitis surgery towards the beginning of last year's Formula 1 season.

While the year ended with the Spaniard leaving Ferrari for the Williams F1 team, he grew as an athlete after such a challenging year. Talking about his experience on the High Performance podcast, he discussed the challenges he faced.

Finishing fifth in the 2024 drivers' championship with 290 points and two race wins, this would be his final year with the Scuderia. But the Australian Grand Prix was especially spectacular, with him taking his first victory of the season despite still recovering from surgery.

"I went to Jeddah and then my appendix decided it was the right time in my career to show up. I had to miss that race.

"It's like life is hitting me hard for some reason in 2024. For some reason they've decided this is my character-building year and I took it a bit like that."

It was the weekend of the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix when Sainz was diagnosed with appendicitis and was rushed to hospital for emergency surgery. While feeling unwell on Thursday, he still managed to complete both practice sessions.

"Like someone up there has decided this is the year to give me a bit of a hard time. I need to fight back, you know. And I remember having the appendix surgery and having to watch the race in the box with the team. I decided to walk into the paddock that day still limping."

While this would floor many of us mere mortals, the driver was back trackside to cheer on his team, team-mate, Charles Leclerc, and reserve driver Oliver Bearman.

"I went to actually help Ollie. I went to a race to sit down with my engineers and help Ollie to try and help the team. And I said, 'You guys decided I cannot continue with this thing, but I'm going to show you my worth apart from just driving fast cars and driving as fast as I can.' And I said, 'What can I do?'

"And I actually went to the paddock that day and said: I'm going to use this as an opportunity to see how my engineers communicate with Ollie, what kind of screens they're seeing, how are they saying things, and I'm actually going to be a third engineer for them to maybe learn what if I was only in the car, what kind of information I would need to get in this exact moment."

Two weeks later, Sainz won the Australian Grand Prix.

“It’s tough, but it’s character-building, as I said. And I came back after that appendix surgery and won that race. And I think I won it because of that attitude - staying positive.

"Because it would have been so easy to become negative and to curse the year, to curse the moment, and to curse life about how bad it's treating you and remain negative. And I think that positivity is what helped me win the race on the comeback."

It should be noted, even Hamilton's session best time was roughly three seconds off the pole lap of 12 months ago, highlighting the evolution that is yet to come in the following sessions.

By the time FP1 came to a close, both the air and track temperatures had dropped by three degrees. This fall is expected to continue into FP2, which takes place at a similar time to both qualifying and the race.

"That was the first session we've had since Toto Wolff's comments on Hamilton's "shelf-life" emerged - the Mercedes boss has since moved to explain what he meant - but for the seven-time world champion that was a response that will have had him smiling under his helmet, while his face flashed up the Vegas night as it shone from the Sphere"

"I know it was only first practice, but that was another unimpressive run for Sergio Perez. His best time is only good enough for 10th place on the time sheets. Time is running out for him to prove he deserves to retain his seat at Red Bull next year. The other aspect is that Red Bull need him to start delivering points if they are to claw back their way into contention to win the constructors' championship."

Completing practice starts on the grid, Verstappen has massively overshot the grid box. Were that to happen in the race, he would be in hot water for that one.

Hamilton's final lap was 0.396s up on Russell. He has 0.953s over Norris in third and all other drivers are over a second back.

And Hamilton moves to the top with a 1m35.001s. With no one else on a hot lap, he will exit the car as the fastest man in the session.

Hamilton is into the final sector of his final effort, as he goes purple in sector one.

The chequered flag flies and Sainz is the first driver to take it.

"So far, so good for the new FIA race director, Rui Marques. Not major incidents like we saw last year so he has been able to easy himself into the big seat left vacant by Niels Wittich, who left the role after the Sao Paulo Grand Prix. We have Toto Wolff in the press conference later, so it will be good to get his thoughts on the shock departure and what he makes of Marques."

Hamilton goes top, but Russell is faster still with a third consecutive flying lap, moving to a 1m35.397s.

And we're about to see what Hamilton can do with soft, as he begins his first timed effort on the compound.

As the click ticks below five minutes, Russell returns Mercedes to the top with a 1m35.619s.

"It is another cold one in Vegas tonight, as soon as the sun disappears the temperature really does drop. While the FP1 action might not set pulses racing, race organisers will be happy to come through unscathed after last year. The fans who have come out for the first running are also making the most of it...maybe just to warm up!"

We're seeing a decent number of drivers in the pits now, we're probably going to see some warm tyres bolted on for a round of closing flying laps to end the session.

Hamilton is the only driver not to have tried soft tyres yet in this session.

10 minutes remain in FP1.

Up from 14th to sixth for Verstappen, but he remains 0.807s off the pace of Norris.

Verstappen reports a "connection issue" with his steering wheel, complaining that the radio "went on by itself". A peculiar problem, for sure.

McLaren has shown its hand for the first time this weekend, with Norris the first driver below 96s, putting in a 1m35.954s, as team-mate Piastri improves to fourth, sandwiching the Ferrari drivers.

Hamilton and Russell are out again but on medium tyres.

But he's immediately forced back by Ferrari team-mate Sainz who hammers in a 1m36.218s.

The first change at the top for a while, as Leclerc now puts in a 1m36.430s to better Hamilton by 0.497s.

And we've had confirmation of a five-place grid penalty for Bottas, after the Sauber driver has had a fourth energy store fitted to his car.

Yellow flags were briefly displayed again there - no explanation why quite yet.

On softs, Leclerc puts in a purple middle and personal bests in the other two sectors to move up to second, behind only Hamilton.

Magnussen is on it once again, moving up to third for Haas. This is the freedom of a driver knowing they aren't driving for their future.

"We have a voice but we don't have a vote," McLaren Racing CEO tells Sky Sports on the changing of the F1 race director. He hopes the move is a "step forward".

On the plus side, no drain issues to this point!

From 10th to third for Norris. The times have largely stabilised for the moment, but with another round of fresh rubber, the picture could all change very quickly.

Highlighting the pit entry issue, Albon has now been shown the same black and white flag as his Williams team-mate for crossing the white line.

"The pit entry line is almost impossible to see," reports Russell. With all the lines of the road, it is hugely difficult to pick out.

As per Chandhok's suggestion, a thick yellow line would clear up any confusion there.

An odd problem for Piastri here, as his McLaren refuses to switch off as his mechanics push the car back into the garage. It's eventually fixed, but as per the roll hoop lights, it was an electrical issue.

Currently, Mercedes enjoy a 1-2 led by Hamilton, with Leclerc leading a Ferrari 3-4. Championship players Norris and Verstappen are 10th and 9th respectively.

While the track is never going to fall completely silent during a session this weekend, half the grid have returned to the pits, resulting in a quieter track.

The first black and white flag of the weekend goes to Colapinto. Currently in 18th, he failed to follow the race director's event notes and crossed the white line on pit entry.

Proving how difficult the conditions are, Verstappen runs deep at the end of The Strip following a heavy lock up - his Red Bull screaming as it slid past the cameras.

C3? We can see a few more than that! Mercedes opted for 25 sets of the medium tyre compound for the Bahrain test, more than any other team, having decided to take only two sets each of the C1 and C2. As the Bahrain track surface is so rough, the C3 will serve as next weekend's softest compound - so the team has already got an eye on the season opener.

After handing victory in the Formula 1 Qatar Grand Prix sprint race to  team-mate  on the final lap,  has another shot at glory in qualifying.

Having repaid Piastri for his own sacrificial gesture in the Brazilian GP sprint, Norris will aim to underline his position as the faster of the papaya drivers by emulating the pace that enabled him to pip  to top spot in sprint qualifying on Friday.

But with Russell keen to strike back at McLaren after being frustrated by Piastri's defence in the sprint, the Las Vegas winner cannot be ruled out of the conversation for the penultimate pole position of the year.

Qualifying gets under way in Losail at 18:00 GMT.

DATE: 2024

Hours after the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix,  was struggling to hold back the tears. A monitor was wheeled out into the paddock to display a farewell video  had produced as a send-off after the Spaniard's four years at Maranello.

All team members were wearing a special cap that Ferrari had produced for the occasion, with Sainz wearing his backwards so the embroidered "Grazie Carlos" message at the back was better visible.

Sainz's faultless second place behind  was not quite enough to help Ferrari snatch the world title away from , but it signified the end of a four-year period in which the 30-year-old left no stone unturned to help his dream team return to the front of Formula 1.

It was also the emotional apotheosis of what has been a challenging year for Sainz, learning on the eve of the season that his fourth campaign in Maranello would be his last, with the Madrid native the unfortunate victim of Ferrari's successful efforts to pry  loose from .

Losing your seat in F1 is never easy, but Sainz had every right to be deflated after he had already proven doubters wrong once before. When his 2021 move to Ferrari was revealed, few observers imagined he would be anything more than a solid second driver to Ferrari's golden child , arguably F1's fastest qualifier.

But while Leclerc indeed had the measure of Sainz over one lap, the Spaniard's talent, determination and work ethic ensured he managed not only to keep up with Leclerc as they traded spells of having the upper hand on each other, but he also played an instrumental role in helping Ferrari turn its form around under team boss Fred Vasseur.

Indeed, some fiery radio messages aside as they fought over the same turf at times, Sainz and Leclerc kept their relationship intact in what has been a complementary alliance, with Leclerc commissioning a tribute helmet to his team-mate for last weekend. It is clear that Ferrari would have been more than happy to continue with the pairing had the unique opportunity to sign Hamilton not presented itself, but with no other top-line seats becoming available, that didn't make Sainz's impending move away from a race-winning car any easier to take.

Carlos Sainz, Ferrari

Sainz bows out with four race wins for Ferrari, two coming this season as he recovered from appendicitis to win in Melbourne, and another in Mexico. "Life is such a rollercoaster," Sainz told F1's Beyond the Grid podcast. "I remember being very emotional on that Australian GP podium because there was my dad there, my manager, my girlfriend. I was obviously thinking about my mom, and they've all seen me suffer during the winter. And when I say suffer, I don't mean I was crying behind closed doors, but I was actually hurt.

"I was hurt because I didn't expect it. I wasn't prepared for that kind of news. I was a bit in shock for a while, and then I regrouped and got training again. But I remember after that win in Australia, thinking about how lucky I am of the people that I have around me, giving me that inner strength to overcome what it was at the time, a tough moment."

Sainz admitted to being angry at the news of his replacement, but over time he has come to accept Ferrari's decision to go after Hamilton at his expense. "I could sit here and say no, but at the time when they give you this news, you're angry. You don't understand it. You curse. You think everything in your life is terrible and you don't understand. But time cures everything.

"You understand Lewis Hamilton, the seven-time world champion, and one of the best if not the best in history, is going to replace you at Ferrari, and you need to be one of the two drivers sacrificed for that to happen. I also understand it was never going to be Charles. Charles has been the project of Ferrari ever since he's been a junior driver.

"So, I understood I had to be the one being replaced from the beginning. I just obviously didn't agree so much at the time. But hey, you end up agreeing and you end up getting on with it. I told [Vasseur and CEO John Elkann] what I thought and moved on and promised them that I was going to give my absolute best for Ferrari."

It would have been easier to move on if other winning seats had become available, but McLaren's line-up is settled and neither Red Bull nor Mercedes decided to make a move for him. Instead, Sainz opted to sign for  over the summer in the knowledge that fighting for race wins would no longer be on his immediate horizon as the British team faces a large-scale rebuild. Following a private filming day Sainz, dressed in all-white overalls, made his official Williams debut on Tuesday's Abu Dhabi tyre test.

"I don't think I fit into the Red Bull situation," he said. "They had me available for six months, and they didn't pick me. And I think it's because I simply don't fit into the type of driver that they need. I'm completely fine with that, so I don't see it like a lost opportunity to not wait till December. With James, I cannot explain to you how much I felt wanted and they did an incredible job convincing me."

Carlos Sainz, Ferrari, Charles Leclerc, Ferrari

Sainz's final Ferrari F1 win came in October, where he dominated the Mexican Grand Prix from pole. As the races as a Ferrari driver kept ticking away, he was acutely aware of Mexico potentially being his last win. Therefore, Ferrari's upswing in form was tinged with melancholy as he realised he was leaving a team that he had helped become capable of competing for championships.

"It is bittersweet because it gives me a feeling Ferrari might be in the fight for the world championship next year and I will not be there to use it," he said at the time. "I think it could have been quite easy for me to lose a bit of motivation and to lose a bit of the drive to make it happen. I'm proud of the way that I've managed to keep myself in it and obviously trying to help the team now as much as I can to win this constructors' [title] because it would be the perfect goodbye.

Ferrari ultimately came up 14 points short to knock McLaren off its perch, but Sainz still gave the send-off he deserved. For his driving and technical abilities and his role in Ferrari's resurgence. But also for the exemplary way he has carried himself over the past 10 months.

"It was emotional on the in-lap with my engineer talking to me on the radio,' he reflected. "At the same time, I'm very grateful to be part of this amazing team for four years. I've had the opportunity to win my first races, my first pole positions, my first podiums.

"I've proven to myself and to everyone that I can be fighting for race wins and for podiums if I have the right car."

F1's smooth operator has proven he is a classy operator, too.

DATE: 2024

Ferrari has announced a "multi-year agreement" with Andretti Formula Racing to supply the Cadillac Formula 1 entry with power units upon its entry to the championship in 2026.

The team, led by TWG Global - which recently took over the running of Andretti Global - and General Motors, was provisionally accepted onto the grid from 2026 by F1 last month, though full confirmation must yet be given.

GM will run the team under the Cadillac brand and, as part of the previous Andretti-named project that was rejected as the 11th team with previous attempts, announced its intention to manufacture its own power unit to race with.

But the date given for that to be a reality was 2028, meaning a power supply was needed for its initial two years of racing.

A statement from Ferrari read: "Ferrari N.V. today announces a multi-year agreement starting from 2026 with Andretti Formula Racing LLC, regarding the supply of power unit and gearbox to the racing team led by TWG Global and General Motors, subject to Andretti Formula Racing LLC receiving written confirmation from the FIA – F1 that its entry to the 2026 FIA Formula One Championship has been accepted and approved."

GM and TWG Global last week announced former Virgin/Marussia/Manor boss Graeme Lowdon as the team principal for the project to help guide the upstart through its initial development.

The move to supply Cadillac will see Ferrari move back to two customer teams from 2026, with Haas remaining with close ties. Sauber, which is currently powered by Ferrari, will use Audi power when it becomes the German marque's works team.

Ferrari team principal Fred Vasseur added: "It's great to see the commitment of another American team, backed by one of the most highly respected marques in the motor industry, at a time when Formula 1 is increasing in popularity in the United States.

"We are delighted therefore that we will be supplying the team with our power unit and gearbox as the basis of this technical collaboration. It means we will continue to have two "customer teams" in the championship with all the benefits this brings in terms of technical development within Ferrari."

Board director, 1978 world champion Mario Andretti, had revealed a deal was struck with Renault under the team's previous guise, but the playing field had changed given the change of management at Andretti Global as well as the decision for the French manufacturer to cease its power supply in the championship and instead switch its Alpine team to Mercedes power.

With that, we'll take a breather for a coffee break before firing up all over again for qualifying which starts at 6am GMT. Until then, go well!

What did we learn from that session ahead of qualifying? Well, Mercedes still appears strong and the track conditions will ramp up with every lap, so it could be a case of the last to set a lap time may triumph.

So, a flurry of very late action to round out FP3 topped by Russell from Piastri, Sainz, Norris, Verstappen and Hamilton.

Anyway, the other 18 drivers minus Perez and Stroll do get to enjoy an out-lap, lap to the grid for a practice start and then an in-lap. Not much to learn, but it still sees the RBs almost collide as Tsunoda gets his braking wrong and nearly goes into the rear of Lawson.

Perez misses the opportunity to get out on track at the back of the car train, so he has to park at the end of the pitlane facing the red light. He's the only one to miss out and it was an odd one given he left a big gap to Russell ahead. He could've made it.

Stroll has come to a stop just outside the Venetian, as the car's red lights turn off so the marshals can recover the Aston Martin. The session will resume - for exactly 60 seconds to be precise.

Stroll's car totally switched off before he came to a halt and the red lights are flashing on his Aston Martin to indicate it isn't safe to touch yet. That could mean the session is effectively over with three minutes to go.

Not for long though, as a red flag is shown with Stroll parked at the side of the track with his Aston Martin smoking.

But just like that Verstappen is suddenly shuffled down to fifth as Russell goes fastest from Piastri, Sainz and Norris. The lap times keep on coming.

"The grip felt miles better," Verstappen reports on team radio. It certainly seems Red Bull has dialled in that car over the last hour.

Verstappen goes fastest of anyone with a 1m34.137s - 0.081s up on Russell. Problems, what problems?

Perez only manages 11th and 1.4s off the outright pace. Where does Verstappen stack up?

Verstappen has bailed out of his first push lap on the softs as Perez carries on. At the front, Russell takes over top spot again with a 1m34.218s.

Aaaaand there they are. Right on cue, Verstappen and Perez come out in formation and both on fresh soft tyres. Let's see what they've got ahead of qualifying.

There are 15 minutes left in FP3 but still no sign of the Red Bull drivers who haven't ventured out on the soft tyres yet.

After seeing so many empty seats for practice two, it is encouraging to see more spectators here for FP3. After asking around, it seems the locals are not bothered about practice, unlike some of the more-established markets. Organisers say they expect a full house on Saturday, so that's where their focus is. It does make it valid to suggest that perhaps, in order to increase ticket sales, Vegas should be selected as a location for the sprint races. At least it would get the punters in.

Russell briefly takes top spot only for his team-mate Hamilton to reply with a 1m34.341s - once again it is looking promising for Mercedes in these cold and slippery conditions. Can it last until the sessions that really matter?

A switch to Hamilton's onboard camera shows he is pushing on the softs, as he goes fastest overall with a 1m34.565s.

Plenty of lap time improvements elsewhere, as Magnussen goes fastest with a 1m34.883s for Haas.

"This is... I can't drive it. I'm gonna crash. My left front is completely f******," Verstappen says, stating his case to pit. Red Bull duly obliges and calls in its driver.

"It's only getting worse. The car is undriveable," Verstappen reports on team radio. "Just a couple more laps please Max. Have to try and make the best of this," Lambiase replies to his driver. That came after a lock-up at Turn 5.

All 20 drivers are on track so suddenly there is a fair bit of traffic to navigate. Hamilton gets caught behind Alonso and then Tsunoda to restrict his opening time lap to 1m36.590s.

Norris and then Piastri take over at the top, the Australian posting a 1m35.759s for top spot in the McLaren 1-2.

Tsunoda blows that theory away with a 1m37.517s to go three seconds quicker than Verstappen. A high number of drivers are on out-laps now so this track will ramp up rapidly over the final 34 minutes.

Norris posts a 1m41.653s to slot into third behind both Red Bulls. Another warm-up lap or is the track really this much slower? Verstappen improves to go top but only with a 1m40.588s.

Norris has come out to be our yardstick, running on the soft tyres, as Perez and Verstappen both improve by a handful of tenths on their next laps.

Verstappen's opening effort is a leisurely 1m42.180s on the medium tyres. It seems hard to believe track conditions mean nine seconds slower than FP2, but let's see what others can produce before drawing conclusions.

Verstappen has had enough of the hanging around in the pits and nips out for the first time in the session, joined by team-mate Perez. Given all the trouble-free running yesterday - just the one short red flag caused by Albon stoppage in FP2 - it perhaps isn't surprising there isn't much track action early in FP3.

The hard tyre scrubbing continues for a handful of drivers, meaning it is just Tsunoda on track at present. And still just the one lap time overall which came from Perez earlier.

It may only be a practice session but Red Bull and Max Verstappen, in particular, will be keen to show improvement on their performance yesterday. We know the wing is an issue but with everything else now turned up to qualifying spec, let’s see where they actually sit in terms of pace.

Lawson, who has also joined the fun scrubbing in his hard tyres, says it is very slippery on track. The circuit reopened for public traffic between FP2 and this session, so it will be a case of rebuilding the grip levels and cleaning the racing line.

"Ah. Miles off," Perez says over team radio after his first timed lap of 1m41.941s. Given FP2's top times were in the 1m33s, he's made an accurate summation.

Both Aston Martins are also in action early while the rest stay comfortable and warm in the garages. Handy, as it is 14.9C air temperature and given the timing of the sessions that is the warmest it'll be all night.

Zhou nips out for an early exploration of the Las Vegas Strip, taking in the sights during his installation lap. He's joined by Perez and Hamilton, with the Red Bull driver sporting a visibly trimmed rear wing - it looks like someone's taken a bite out of it.

Off we go for final practice!

admits he was already planning on how to make  faster by remembering the feeling of his  as he finished second at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

The Spaniard will be replaced by  next year and has agreed to join Williams, where instead of competing for race wins, the initial challenge will be to turn the team into one which scores points on a regular basis.

Sainz won two races in 2024 but, alongside , was unable to deliver the constructors’ championship for Ferrari, which was beaten by  by just 14 points.

As Sainz aimed to catch race winner , he conceded that his mind had already started turning to how to improve Williams when he arrives in Grove.

Asked if it was hard to move on so quickly, Sainz replied: “Being very honest with you, I don't think so. I think, I'm not going to lie, my last laps, as much as I was pushing like hell for this team and trying to, I was already starting to feel things in the car and trying to say, ‘remember how this feels’.

“Because tomorrow and Tuesday I need to remember, why is this car quick in this corner and why does it feel good? Because I know probably what I'm going to find tomorrow, and Tuesday needs some margin of improvement in the corners that I was feeling the car. So this just sums up that I'm already looking also ahead.

“I'm extremely motivated for the challenge that I have ahead of me. Today is a day to try and enjoy as much as possible with the team as my last day in red.

“We still have some days in Maranello coming up, but obviously my competitive mind is already looking forward to Monday and Tuesday and to see how I can make that Williams car faster.”

Williams struggled at the back end of the season, taking just one point from the final six races of the year and finishing ninth in the standings with only  behind the team.

Not since ’s second place at the truncated 2021 Belgium Grand Prix has Williams had a driver on the podium, and Sainz admits he cannot guarantee the next time.

“That is a question that I cannot answer,” he added.

“It's impossible to predict the future, impossible to know how long it's going to take me and Williams to be back fighting for podium positions.

“I think James [Vowles, Williams team principal] said it the other day and calmed everyone's expectations, that next year is going to be a tough year and a learning year before we prepare for the change of regulations in ‘26, where I believe the team is investing and the team is preparing to maximise that chance.

“What I can tell you is that I'm as determined as ever to help that team to be back where it belongs. I personally feel like I belong to be fighting for wins, podiums and top fives in Formula 1. I think I've proven it these last four years as a driver. I think I belong to that. But Williams cannot forget that Williams also belongs to fighting for these top five and podium places.

“And together with the determination and the strength that I think we're going to show together, the target is to get Williams and myself fighting for those positions in the near future, in the nearest future. How long that's going to take, I cannot tell you.”

Carlos Sainz returned to F1 after his appendectomy, and, in great style, claimed the top spot in a Ferrari 1-2. Helped by Max Verstappen's early retirement in the race, would Ferrari still have won if Verstappen was fighting at the front? Coupled with Mercedes's dual DNFs, Alonso's penalty and more, the Australian GP certainly brought up a lot of talking points.

’s first season at  did not live up to expectation, and his disappointing results sparked questions about the seven-time Formula 1 world champion’s future in the series. The 40-year-old has sought to silence his naysayers, arguing that he ‘still has a dream’ keeping him in F1.

Hamilton joined the Scuderia at the start of 2025 following 12 campaign with , which saw him clinch six of his seven titles. The Briton’s success coupled with a title challenge from Ferrari in 2024 left many expecting a serious challenge from the team this season.

That didn't happen, as Ferrari dropped from second to fourth in the constructors' standings and neither Hamilton nor team-mate  picked up a grand prix win in 2025. The disappointing results led some to suggest that Hamilton should retire from F1, instead of seeing out his multi-year contract at the Italian outfit.

When asked for a response to those questioning his future after the , the seven-time world champion said: “I wouldn't say anything to them. None of them have done what I've done, so they're not even on my level.”

Hamilton’s highpoint of the year , and his low was towards the end of the season when he became the first full-time Ferrari F1 driver to be knocked out in Q1 at three consecutive grands prix.

While the stellar results that Hamilton is used to didn't arrive this year, he outlined what has kept him focused over the course of a tough campaign.

“It's the love for what you do, it's the love for racing,” he said. “I've got amazing support from people around me, my fans. It's that constant keeping an eye on the dream. I still have a dream that I hold hope in my heart for and that's what I work towards.”

As Hamilton explained when he signed for Ferrari, that dream is to win races and championships with F1’s most historic team. The impending regulation change that will hit F1 next year is the Briton’s best chance, .

However, if the wins don’t come and Hamilton does step away from the series, there will at least be one aspect of F1 that he won’t miss. “I can't wait to get away from all this. Every week, photoshoots and all that kind of stuff,” he added. “That's the thing I look forward to one day, not having to do it all.”

DATE: 2025

Former Top Gear and The Grand Tour executive producer Andy Wilman has revealed that  personally overruled  boss Ron Dennis to appear in the BBC show's "Star in a Reasonably Priced Car" segment in the famous and humble Suzuki Liana instead of a  supercar.

Speaking on the Midweek F1 podcast, Wilman explained that the seven-time champion's first visit to the Dunsfold test track came straight off the back of his rookie Formula 1 season, in which he missed the championship win by just a single point.

“Well, the first time he came down, I think it was when he just lost that rookie season, the championship by [one point],” Wilman said. “So McLaren is still Ron Dennis days, so we're getting all Ron Dennis-ish-ness coming down the phone, like 'he's in a Suzuki Liana,' you know?

"And then like I think it was Matt Bishop was a PR at the time. Matt Bishop sort of rings and he goes, ‘Oh, Ron wants him to do it in like an SLR.’”

Wilman admitted that the Top Gear team pushed back hard, insisting that the whole point of the segment was to level the playing field with the modest Suzuki.

“And we're like, ‘It's not the point, like... same car,'” he continued. “And he went, ‘Yeah, you know what Ron's like.’ And Ron's gone, ‘Yeah, but he's a Mercedes man.’ And we're like, ‘Jesus Christ, Ron, is anybody going to go, well, I'm going to buy a Liana now. I won't buy that S-Class.’ It's like, let it go.”

Hamilton's love for the British car show was a strong motivator for the young driver, who was keen to join presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May in their famous studio.

“And then I think Lewis stepped in even as a kid and went, ‘I'm doing Top Gear,’ because he was such a kid and he'd grown up watching it, you know?” Wilman said. “So, it was a red-letter day for him. Now, obviously now he's stratospheric and everything bows to him, but back then he was like, ‘I'm coming down.’”

The now-Ferrari driver would go on to set a very competitive lap time in the Suzuki, matching Jenson Button's lap time despite driving in wet conditions.

"He was amazing. I remember watching that second-to-last corner," the producer continued. "He was incredible, which was that sort of... I don't know who came up with it, but it's like you're going from a motorway to a country lane almost at a right angle.

"And he seemed to get it better than anyone else. But it was a wet time so he wasn't top of the board."

Hamilton eventually set the fastest time on the board on his second attempt with a time of 1m42.9s, only to be beaten by former F1 driver  by seven tenths soon after.

DATE: 2025

Formula 1 boss Fred Vasseur is unfazed by his drivers  and  being publicly critical of the squad even though it irked John Elkann.

The 2025 F1 campaign was highly disappointing for the Scuderia, as it failed to win a grand prix and dropped to fourth in the championship having lost the 2024 title to  on the final day.

Leclerc and Hamilton, who finished fifth and sixth in the drivers’ standings, have therefore often cut very frustrated figures in post-session interviews; at the Brazilian Grand Prix, for example, the seven-time world champion said “it’s a nightmare” following a double DNF.

, who claimed the pair need “to focus on driving and talk less” in a comment that prompted widespread debate.

Yet Vasseur has little interest in what the drivers say publicly, because to him what matters are the interactions behind the scenes.

“I don't pay attention to the reaction in the TV pen,” said Vasseur, after Ferrari finished fourth and eighth at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

“The most important for me is to have a guy coming back to us and pushing the team to do a better job and to work all together to try to get better results.

“The fact that they are emotional sometimes on the radio and it depends on the guys... all of you know Charles. [He] is always a bit of critical with himself first and with the team and with everybody, but it's always with a positive dynamic.

“I know Charles for 10 years, 16 years and he was always like this. He was always complaining about everything. But it's a positive dynamic that we are there just to do a better job.

“It doesn't matter if you are P4, P3, P1. The DNA is to do a better job. I accept this perfectly and the most important [thing] for me is that they keep the same approach to the debriefing. To try to get a better car, a better team, a better everything and it's like this that we will improve.”

Vasseur instead went as far as saying that he actually encourages his drivers to be critical of the team, because that is simply how Ferrari returns to the top when the new regulations come in next year.

“I would be destroyed if I had the drivers telling me that we are doing a good job,” he added. “The summary of the season for a driver is to find where we can improve. Always that I'm not there to have [drivers telling me] 'we are doing a good job on this and this and this'.

“But their DNA and my DNA is to try to push the team to do a better job. It means, they have to come to us, Charles and Lewis, when it's not Lewis, it's Charles, it's both of them. They have to come to us and to push the team on the limit. Everywhere, on every single area and for sure, we can improve and we can improve everywhere.

“But last year, we were fighting until the last corner and the reaction was exactly the same. And Charles said, ‘OK guys, we have to improve on every single area. The simulator, the set-up, the aero’.

“This is the DNA of their job and the DNA of our sport. I'm not shocked at all when they are coming to me and say, Fred, we have to improve on this, this, this, this, this because it's what we are asking them to do.”

has responded to rumours linking his close friend Serena  to a return to professional tennis.

The 44-year-old was ranked as the world No. 1 in women's singles by the Women's Tennis Association for 319 weeks, which is the third-most of all time. She has 73 WTA Tour-level singles titles to her name, including 23 major women's singles titles.

Williams retired in September 2022, but there have been rumblings of a potential return for the American.

"I'd love to. I keep telling her to come back," Hamilton explained when asked if he would like to see Williams return. "I'm a massive supporter of her. She's the greatest of all time, such a legend. She was at one of the races just recently. She's a dear friend as well, which I'm really honoured to be able to say."

The rumours were sparked by Williams's re-entering the tennis anti-doping testing pool, which led many to believe she could return in 2026. While the rumours have continued to spread, Williams attempted to squash the discussion on social media. "Omg, y'all I’m NOT coming back. This wildfire is crazy-," she posted.

Hamilton and Williams have been friends for some time. The seven-time Formula 1 champion previously paid tribute to the tennis star, branding her the greatest of all time.

"Taking a moment before the race today to show my appreciation and gratitude to the greatest of all time, Serena Williams," he posted in September 2022 when she announced her retirement.

"We will never see another Serena. She’s one of a kind. She came through like a wrecking ball and has been so spectacular to witness. She has such fierceness, power, and strength in both body and mind. To be so bold, Black, brave and, above all, a kind and caring human being is beautiful.

"I remember watching her and Venus at their first games with my dad on TV. Seeing such talented women dominating a field where no one looked like them gave me hope. They made me believe that superheroes are real, and they can look [like] me and my family. I never dreamed in a million years I would meet these heroes and come to call them my friends. I knew that I wasn’t alone because of you. I knew I could never give up because you didn’t. I can’t thank you two enough.

"Still today you remind me to never give up, you remind me what we stand for and I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. You make me want to be better in all ways. A better competitor, a better brother, a better friend, and a better leader. You inspire me every day and just know you always have a brother in me. Serena, I’m wishing you all the happiness in what’s next for you. You truly deserve it."

DATE: 2025

During the post-season test at the Yas Marina Circuit, Formula 1 teams are given nine hours to gather data about Pirelli’s 2026 tyres.

The test is carried out using mule cars – ground-effect machinery modified to mimic 2026’s lower downforce levels. All teams run with reduced wing levels (comparable to Monza) and altered ride heights to shed downforce.

An interesting aspect is that the FIA has permitted teams to run certain prototypes in Tuesday’s test. One area where this applies is the front wing.

DRS will disappear from F1 in 2026 and be replaced by active aerodynamics, meaning drivers will open both the front and rear wings on every straight. As a result, the front wing will become an active component too, unlike in previous seasons.

A first glimpse of the future can be seen in Abu Dhabi on the Mercedes mule car driven by Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The car is equipped with a Straight Line Mode system, allowing the front wing to generate less drag on the straights.

Mercedes’ system at this test is far from refined, with an actuation system on the upper wing elements connected to the nose cone with via large tubing. This allows the wing to switch to a low-downforce configuration on the straights, mirroring what will be used in a more sophisticated way in 2026.

Ferrari has also gained experience with a similar concept. The Scuderia tested its own prototype during a private mule-car test and has also brought its own system to Abu Dhabi.

Besides offering teams early insight into active aerodynamics, these prototypes also provide valuable data to Pirelli. The Italian tyre supplier can compare mule cars running without active front aerodynamics to those equipped with the system.

“Talking about the front Straight Line Mode, the FIA gave the opportunity to the teams to develop a system that was replicating this on the front wing. In that case, obviously, they don't have to comply with the speed limit restriction,” Pirelli’s Mario Isola explained. Mule cars have a speed limit of about 300km/h on straights to avoid overloading the tyres.

“It's also useful for us because you can compare a car that is running without the system with a car that is running with the system. When we did the first test with Ferrari with the system, it was really useful to understand and to compare this test with all the other tests, in terms of load and what we achieved, to understand and to make the other tests more representative.”

In addition to the active front wing, some teams are running wheel rims that form a hybrid solution between current rims and those planned for 2026.

“In some cases, teams ask for testing rims similar to the ones they are going to use next year, when they obviously have more freedom in designing the rim. And they have been authorized by the FIA to do a certain number of runs with the new rims.”

However, the results of those tests are not entirely representative for next year, as tyre heat management also heavily depends on the brakes – and the brakes will be different in 2026. All teams in Abu Dhabi are still running the current-spec brakes.

DATE: 2025

The 2025 Formula 1 competitive season may be over, but track activity is not: all 20 cars will be in action in  on Tuesday.

Each team will have one mule car driven by one or both race drivers, featuring Pirelli’s new range of rubber for the 2026 season, with slightly smaller and narrower tyres.

Even the tyres’ construction will be significantly different due to F1’s new technical regulations. When Pirelli asked all F1 teams to submit their predicted downforce levels for the end of 2026, there was much disparity between their simulations.

“It was more difficult for teams to estimate the performance of their 2026 cars at the end of the season,” Pirelli’s Mario Isola explained. “But we needed those simulations because we needed to design a product that is lasting for one year. If they just give us an idea of the car performance at the start of the season, and if we don't know what the rate of development will be, then it's difficult for us.”

Pirelli has therefore developed a broad spectrum of compounds, in case the real-world downforce levels turn out to be higher or lower than predicted by the teams.

The mule cars are 2025-spec machinery that has been modified to drop down closer to next year’s much lower downforce levels, though it cannot be fully accurate, partly because the 2026 cars will feature active aerodynamics.

“We have discussed some limitations with the teams, based on those first tests,” Isola added. “For example, we decided to avoid overloading the tyres on the straights. We were testing with a speed limit at 290km/h or 300km/h, because clearly they will have a lot less downforce on the straights next year. So we agreed on some methodologies for testing with the teams. Thanks to these methodologies it was possible to have feedback from the mule cars that was a little bit more coherent, more close.”

The test won’t change the 2026 compounds in any case, as the tyres have already been homologated for next season; it will simply help Pirelli choose the compounds for next year.

The Italian manufacturer has brought all compounds to Yas Marina Circuit except for the hardest dry-weather tyre, the C1, and the full-wet.

Meanwhile, the other 10 cars will be driven by rookies as part of the traditional end-of-season young drivers’ test. Only competitors with two grand prix starts or fewer are allowed to take part.

A number of 2025 race drivers will be skipping Tuesday's test.

The  driver went on to finish the race in third behind  and , which was enough to clinch his first championship title.

"I'm really, really happy for him," Hamilton told the media after the race. "He did such a great job this season."

The seven-time champion spoke with Norris ahead of the race and gave him some advice on dealing with the pressure of fighting for his first championship.

"I told him going into the weekend, just continue doing you. What you've been doing works, so don't change it. Go into the weekend and just take it one corner at a time.

"Clearly, that's what he did. Great to see another Brit win a championship. Awesome for the sport. It went right down to the last race. What more can you ask for?"

Norris's championship is the first drivers' title for McLaren since Hamilton's first championship in 2008. "They won the championship last year, but drivers' one, yes. It's great to see McLaren back up there," he added.

The McLaren driver made a noticeable mental turnaround during the season. After a reset during the summer break, he came back much stronger and seemed to handle the pressure with more ease.

When asked about Norris talking about mental health, Hamilton reiterated the importance of people showing vulnerability.

"I mean, I don't know... I can't really comment. I don't know what he said, so I can't really say much," Hamilton said. "I think it's great that people can show their vulnerability. It's a real thing in today's world. It should be taken seriously."

Hamilton finished the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in eighth, which meant he ended his first season with  in sixth with 156 points, 86 points behind his new team-mate .

Lando Norris has crowned himself the 2025 Formula 1 world champion. The McLaren driver managed to withstand all pressure during the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and was visibly emotional after clinching the title. Norris explained in the champion’s press conference how important the lessons from the early part of this season have been, and what role the mental aspects have played in that process. Max Verstappen, for his part, still completed a memorable comeback and said that he feels better in Abu Dhabi now than he did twelve months ago. According to him, that is partly because the atmosphere within the team is better than it was a year ago and because Red Bull managed to turn the year around. That said, it does not automatically mean that everything at Red Bull will remain exactly the same for next year. Ronald Vording discusses it all in a new F1 Update, including the background to Helmut Marko’s hint in the paddock and the emotion shown by Gianpiero Lambiase. The episode concludes with attention for Oscar Piastri and Ferrari’s disappointing season.

2016 Formula 1 champion  has urged his former  team-mate  not to give up on  or retire from the series after his tough first season with the Maranello outfit.

Hamilton has struggled to adapt to Ferrari since joining in 2025, which has led to questions about his future in the championship.

The Briton has made it clear he is eager to put the current regulations behind him and look ahead to 2026.

"I think he has to continue," Rosberg told Sky Sports F1. "Stopping now is not cool. He only just started this Ferrari project. To give up after only one season doesn't work.

"He has to continue, give it another shot and hope he feels comfortable in that next-year car. Maybe the car is a good car? This year's car is not great. His great struggle this year was qualifying pace.

"In the race there was flashes of brilliance that we kept seeing. It's just qualifying pace and with the car being so different next year, maybe he can find some of that old magic again in qualifying. The hope is still there, definitely."

Former driver and Sky Sports analyst  added: "The trouble is his stats and his reputation is not being enhanced with this. I would have thought he'll wait to see if Ferrari get it together for 2026.

"He'll see how he's going and how they are going and if he's enjoying. I think if we're asking that question a year from now and he's had a difficult season, it would be completely different. I would be very surprised if he just switches it off this winter."

While Hamilton's post-race interview following the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was fairly doom and gloom, he claimed that the passion of his fans, the support around him and his love for racing are what push him to keep going.

"It's the love for what you do. It's the love for racing," the seven-time champion said. "I've got amazing support from people around me, my fans. It's that constant keeping an eye on the dream. I still have a dream that I hold hope in my heart for, and that's what I work towards."

is ready to put the 2025 Formula 1 season behind him as he looks to throw his phone "in the fricking bin" to disconnect during the winter break.

The seven-time champion joined  at the start of 2025. While the anticipation of his blockbuster move to the Maranello outfit peaked, the Briton struggled to adapt to the new team and car. The high points of his season, results-wise, were his sprint race victory in China and fourth-place finishes at the Emilia Romagna, British, Austrian and United States Grands Prix.

Hamilton is also eager to leave the ground-effect cars behind. "There's not a single thing I'll miss about these cars," he told the media ahead of the race weekend in Abu Dhabi. "It is as simple as that. I have not enjoyed it."

Discussing his season and his eighth-place finish in the race at the Yas Marina Circuit, Hamilton said after the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: "At the moment, I'm only looking forward to the break. Just disconnecting, not speaking to anyone. No one's going to be able to get a hold of me this winter. I won't have my phone with me. I'm looking forward to that. Just completely unplugged from the matrix."

Asked if he had taken that approach in a winter break previously, he added: "Not particularly. I wouldn't say that. No, I've generally always had it around, but this time it's going in the fricking bin."

The Ferrari driver is also keen to take a break from the additional responsibilities he has as a driver.

"Disconnect? I'll find out when I do it," he said when asked how important the disconnect will be for him, "but I can't wait to get away from all this. Every week, photoshoots and all that kind of stuff. That's the thing I look forward to one day, not having to do it all."

"It's incredible. Pretty surreal. I dreamed of this for a long, long time - everyone does - a lot goes into a season like this. A lot of ups, a lot of downs, but none of that matters if you try to come out on top. The last seven, eight years I've been with McLaren, the last 17, 18 years of my life I've been chasing this dream.

"My best performances this year came when I needed them the most."

The moment Lando crossed the line to become champion.

But queue the champagne, as Norris does his trademark celebration as a world champion for the first time!

Piastri lifts the runner-up trophy on the podium. It does look like he's trying to put on a brave face - a penny for his thoughts etc.

PR email of the day, dropped almost the second the grand prix finished. A street in Somerset, Lando's home county, will be named in his honour. It's almost like they had that planned and ready to go!

Norris: "I've not cried in a while. DIdn't think I'd cry but I did. It's a long journey, a long journey."

Speaking of the championship, here is how the top three finishes:

1. Lando Norris - 423 points

2. Max Verstappen - 421 points

3. Oscar Piastri - 410 points

It's hugmania on that pit straight. Zak, Sainz, Russell, mechanics, family, all wanting a bit of Lando.

But the cameras did catch a nice moment when Norris' mum headed over to Piastri to console the other McLaren driver, who finishes this year third in the championship.

As is customary in Abu Dhabi, Norris is now doing doughnuts down the start-finish straight...

Verstappen: "I'm definitely not disappointed. I'm proud of everyone, we never give up."

A tearful Norris: "I love you guys, thanks for everything - you deserve it. I love you mum, I love you dad."

Camera pans straight to the McLaren garage, where Lando's mum is crying. These moments are the ones to savour...

LANDO NORRIS IS THE 2025 FORMULA 1 WORLD CHAMPION

At the start of 2025 Ferrari had a lot of hopes: race wins, pole positions and even the prospect of Hamilton finally getting his eighth title were all on the table - but then, when lights went out in Melbourne, things started to unravel. Sadly, that’s been the story at Ferrari ever since – excitement followed by disappointment for Lewis Hamilton and his team-mate Charles Leclerc. With speculation surrounding Team Principal Fred Vasseur's role currently being called into question, we have to ask what is really going on at Ferrari, and what chances does it have of turning around its fortunes?

It's the first glance at the biggest driver transfer of the modern age as Lewis Hamilton headed to Maranello for his first Ferrari test this week. The first image of Lewis by Enzo Ferrari's office was liked over 5,000,000 times, one of the most liked posts in the sport's social media history. Ben Hunt is joined by Filip Cleeren and Jake Boxall-Legge to break down the early news from such a huge event.

Together, they talk about what Lewis has been doing across his first three days in Maranello, the team he's putting together behind the scenes, the challenges he faces as he adapts to life in red, and whether between Lewis and Ferrari, they can challenge for a title immediately in 2025.
