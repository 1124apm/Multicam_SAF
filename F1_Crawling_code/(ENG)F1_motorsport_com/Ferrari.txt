Vettel was given a guard of honour by his Ferrari mechanics as he left his pit garage ahead of the race, which ended in disappointment for the Scuderia as both Vettel and teammate Charles Leclerc slipped back from their starting positions.

Ferrari announced back in May that Vettel would leave the team at the end of the 2020 season and he later signed a deal to replace Sergio Perez at the Racing Point squad that will become Aston Martin for next season.

"It was an emotional day," Vettel told Motorsport.com after the race at the Yas Marina track.

"I mean the result is nothing to mention, the race is nothing to mention, but yeah, I really enjoyed the little gestures starting from the beginning of the weekend.

[From] The mechanics, the engineers – all these people that I worked with for so long in those years, and so hard. So yeah, I shall miss a few of them very much.

"But it's good to be around [in F1 next season] and I'll get to see them."

Vettel also said that he was "happy obviously that the season is over" because "it was quite tough and tiring. I'm looking forward to the next one."

The German used the cool-down lap to sing his version of popular Italian song 'Azzurro' for Ferrari.

Vettel and Leclerc ran together in the early stages of the race after the latter's grid penalty meant they lined up alongside each other in P12 and P13 on the grid.

They were boosted up the order as Ferrari opted not to stop during the virtual safety car period triggered by Sergio Perez's retirement – which was later upgraded to a fully safety car – but the duo were overcome by the cars that had been running ahead of them and did chose to come as the race wore.

"At some stage obviously I struggled and the safety car didn't really help us because obviously we were on a mirror strategy to most of the cars," Vettel said of his race on Sunday.

"So, yeah, it didn't really work in our favour. But yeah, we still tried to hang in there as much as possible."

DATE: 2020

Ferrari has encountered a number of issues at pitstops this year, most recently at the Sakhir Grand Prix when Sebastian Vettel lost time due to slow stops.

Vettel said after the race in Bahrain that the pit equipment "probably needs an overhaul" after completing stops taking 4.5 seconds and 6.5 seconds.

The team revealed ahead of this weekend's season finale in Abu Dhabi that over 20% of its pitstops this year have taken over 3.5 seconds.

By comparison, Red Bull has regularly topped the pitstop times this season, achieving a sub-two second stop at four of the last seven races.

Ferrari acknowledged ahead of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix that its average pitstop time "is a long way off the best", and "there might have been a few more points on the scoreboard" with quicker services.

It has now revealed that a wheel nut issue has been identified as the root cause of the slow pitstops, with plans in place to rectify the problem for next year.

"It's true that the number of stops over 3.5 seconds is too high by the Scuderia's past standards, but the vast majority of times that there has been a less than optimal stop, it has been down to a specific problem linked to the wheel nut," said Diego Ioverno, Ferrari's vehicle operation engineer.

"The thread is not strong enough and so the nut has stripped several times. It's a reliability problem we are working hard on to fix for next year.

"When the guys feel, even unconsciously, that they are using a component that is more at risk, with a margin of error for engaging the wheel-gun that is much smaller, that has a negative effect on the whole procedure.

"That can be seen from the fact that for us, an average time for a good pitstop is 2.73 seconds, which means there is room for improvement there too."

Ioverno also explained that the Ferrari pit crew is "relatively new" as part of Ferrari's ongoing restructuring and rebuild, and would take time to gel together.

"It is clear therefore that it takes a little time for all those involved in the pitstop to gel," he said.

"There is no other sport that calls on perfect synchronisation of over twenty people. That's why the best teams are the ones that have used the same crew for several years.

"So, apart from reliability, we also need to work on this area, both through specific training sessions and psychological and physical training and that will be another priority over the winter in preparation for 2021."

DATE: 2020

Leclerc slumped to 12th place in qualifying on Saturday at the Bahrain International Circuit, losing out in Q2 to Ferrari teammate Sebastian Vettel, who will start one place ahead in 11th.

It marked just the fourth time this year that Vettel has managed to outqualify Leclerc, who has led Ferrari’s efforts through much of the season so far.

For Leclerc, it was a further turnaround in fortunes given he took his maiden F1 pole position in Bahrain last year and was on course to win the race prior to an engine issue.

Mekies said that Leclerc appeared to lack his normal level of confidence with the SF1000 car in Bahrain so far this weekend.

“I’m sure if you ask him, he will probably tell you that he doesn’t have his usual level of confidence as he’s had around here,” Mekies said.

“We are working hard with the team to try to support him best, to give him the tools and give him the car he needs to have that.

“I think there was some small progress. We did see this level of confidence growing. We are missing something for qualy today.

“Hopefully with the race tomorrow, we are back in the fight.”

Ferrari scored its best two-car result of the season so far last time out in Turkey as Vettel and Leclerc finished third and fourth respectively.

The result gave Ferrari a boost in its bid to move up from its current placing of sixth in the constructors’ championship, only for its midfield rivals to then qualify further up the order in Bahrain.

Mekies was braced for a close fight in Sunday’s race, believing as many as 12 cars would be evenly-matched in the midfield tussle.

“What you saw in qualy in terms of how close you have these 12 cars together, I think you will see a lot of in the race,” Mekies said.

“You always have a few guys that manage it better, a few guys that manage it worse, and therefore the gap spreads a little bit. But I expect a very, very tight fight.

“We have tried to approach quite race-focused. We have saved two sets of hards. There are a few cars in that situation but not so many. We will see if we need them tomorrow or if that pays off.

“But we are gearing up for a good fight with 12 cars tomorrow.”

DATE: 2020

Binotto and Wolff clashed earlier this year in the wake of the secret deal that was put in place between the FIA and Ferrari regarding legality doubts over the Maranello team’s 2019 powerunit.

Wolff was  that all teams had been impacted by technical directives regarding engines – so Ferrari wasn’t alone in being caught out.

“Another complete bullshit story, technical directives,” said Wolff. “There's a clear regulation on power units.”

Wolff has also said that he felt sad that Ferrari had endured difficulties this year because of choices made by certain individuals there.

“It’s maybe the decisions that have been made within the team, from certain members of the team,” he claimed.

But while the relationship between the Mercedes and Ferrari bosses has appeared to be quite tense, Binotto does not see any particular tension between them.

“Do we ‘hate’ each other,” said Binotto in an interview with Sky Italia, when asked about his relationship with Wolff.

“In a sporting respect, he is my main opponent who has been winning for many years. But it is not hatred.

“There is respect and a desire to beat him, but not for the sake of beating Toto and Mercedes. It’s to bring Ferrari back to the top, and the place where it deserves to be.”

Binotto insisted that there was nothing underhand about the deal Ferrari reached with the FIA over the winter, and is clear that if rivals had been unhappy with his team’s engine last year then the door was always open to them to protest.

“No opponent last year filed a protest against us,” he said. “What was done later [after the season] started from the FIA’s desire to continue its investigations and analysis at a time when we were focused on developing the car for the 2020 season.

“We thus reached a simple agreement: let us focus on the future, let us help each other to understand what are the possible grey areas in the rules. And where clarifications were needed, clarifications were made.

"The agreement was secret because it was obvious it should be. Should we have shown everyone our engine?

“I don't think anyone has ever done that in Formula 1, and no one will ever do that in the future.

“With regards to the 'grey' area, it was like that throughout the 2019 season until new directives arrived, and they were also defined thanks to our help.

“These directives had an impact on all engines, but on us to a greater extent."

Despite Ferrari’s difficult season, Binotto says the response in Maranello has been the right one – with the staff having come together amid its troubles rather than trying to blame each other.

"It's a fantastic group of people,” said Binotto. “We are going through a difficult period, and in such a context it is easy for tensions to arise, to point the finger at your desk neighbour.

“Instead, we are a compact team that is working with only one goal, plus we have the support of our president and CEO.

“We believe in this sport and in the future. It is a Ferrari that despite a not easy sporting moment, and with all the difficulties that the COVID period has entailed, has solid foundations on which to build and look forward.”

DATE: 2020

Ferrari has struggled for pace throughout the 2020 F1 season, languishing down in sixth place in the constructors’ championship due to both aerodynamic and engine deficits.

In a bid to rectify its aerodynamic issues, the Maranello outfit has developed a wide array of upgrades, which it has rolled out over the past two weeks. Upgrades introduced at the Russian and Eifel grands prix .

At this weekend’s Portuguese GP, Ferrari will complete the set of upgrades with a new diffuser. “We already introduced a few small modifications to the car’s aero package in Sochi and added others at the Nurburgring,” Ferrari’s Head of Performance Development Enrico Cardile explained.

“In Portimao we will have a further update, mainly to the diffuser, completing the programme set out over the past few months.”

Ferrari’s previous updates were deemed a relative success on the evidence of Charles Leclerc taking fourth in qualifying on the Nurburgring and finishing seventh, backing up a sixth-place finish in Sochi.

According to team boss Mattia Binotto the upgrades were not expected to deliver huge performance gains, but showed the Italian squad was .

Cardile hopes Ferrari will “get confirmation” at Portimao that its development is “on the right track” after being plagued by correlation issues in the Maranello windtunnel.

"Indications from the past few grands prix are positive and we hope the same will apply this weekend," Cardile added. "We have to consider that, more than ever this year, development is aimed at the following season.

"All the same, we still expect to see a performance improvement with the SF1000. It would be very useful to at least find ourselves heading the group of cars and drivers currently fighting within just a few tenths for places four and lower.”

For 2021, F1 teams are only allowed a limited redevelopment of the current car, which will also undergo a downforce cut as mandated by the tweaked technical regulations.

Ferrari  that it will spend its entire allowance of two development tokens for the 2021 season on the rear of its troubled car.

Cardile explained that Ferrari, which is also working on a new power unit, is targeting a rear-end revamp because it "offers the biggest margin for improvement”.

"I say that not just because it’s the area of the car where pretty significant changes have been introduced in the technical regulations, but also we believe that because of the way our car is laid out, we could really make significant progress,” he said. "That’s why we’ve decided to spend our two tokens allowed in the rules in this very area.

"When we look at the standings, seeing ourselves down in sixth place hurts and we are well aware that it is not a position worthy of Ferrari. We absolutely want to improve, for us and for our fans who still support us with passion, even at difficult times like the ones we are going through now.”

DATE: 2020

Vettel joined Ferrari in 2015 with the target of emulating his childhood hero Michael Schumacher and bring another world title to Maranello.

The four-time world champion finished runner-up in the championship in both 2017 and 2018 and scored 14 wins with Ferrari, but following a disappointing 18-month period Ferrari decided it would not renew Vettel's expiring contract after the 2020 season and bring in McLaren’s Carlos Sainz as his replacement.

Vettel, who will replace Sergio Perez at , stated he had no regrets about his five-year spell at Ferrari, but admitted his time at the Italian team was a failure.

"It is true that I have failed because I set myself the mission or the target to win the championship with Ferrari,” Vettel said on the F1 podcast Beyond the Grid. "I have failed. I didn't manage to do that.”

The German didn’t manage to thrive in the highly political environment at Maranello and concedes he could have done some things differently behind the scenes.

“There's things that I should have done better, things that maybe I should have seen earlier, fights that maybe I shouldn't have picked,” he explained.

"But, then again, I think everything that happened brought me to where I am now. If I'm fair and harsh then I have failed. Were there reasons? Probably yes, but I don't accept them as excuses. So, whatever happened also put me on the next step forward and next level.”

“Maybe [the fights] weren't worth fighting, but then again part of it is probably my nature. And I think I had a point as well in some of these little fights and battles. But I think ultimately that's how you mature and how you learn. I'm happy to move on.”

Vettel is looking forward to his fresh start at Aston Martin, the new identity of the current Racing Point outfit, working with what will be a much smaller team than Ferrari.

The 33-year-old said he is relishing a new challenge at a “fun project” after being convinced to join by owner Lawrence Stroll and explained there are a lot of factors that made him join the Silverstone team.

"I think those boxes were quite easy to tick in terms of the performance, the racing side of things, where the team is, where the team might be, the potential and so on,” he added.

"And it sounds like a fun project, and something that ultimately I decided I want to be part of. It is very different to Ferrari, obviously Racing Point as it stands today and in the future Aston Martin will be growing.

"There will be a lot of things happening for the first time, and I think it's an incredible challenging journey for the whole team. And me joining I hope I can contribute a lot of things and do good in the car and outside the car."

DATE: 2020

As  earlier this week, Ferrari will honour its 1000th race by running a special classic livery design for the Tuscan Grand Prix.

Ferrari announced on Wednesday that both SF1000 cars driven by Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel will race in the burgundy shade that was used on the Ferrari 125 cars the team made its debut with in 1950.

Both Leclerc and Vettel will have special race suits for the race weekend, tying in with the classic livery, which also has retro numbering and a ‘1000 GP’ logo on the engine cover.

“Scuderia Ferrari’s 1000th Grand Prix is a very important milestone, therefore it had to be marked in a special way,” said Piero Ferrari, vice-chairman of Ferrari.

“That’s why we decided to run a unique livery on the cars for this event, with the SF1000s taking to the track at the Mugello Circuit in the Burgundy colour first seen on the 125, the first racing car to carry the Ferrari name.

“Even the look of the race numbers on Charles’ and Sebastian’s cars will reflect the tradition of the past, giving the impression of being hand painted onto the bodywork, while the drivers’ race suits will also match the car colour.”

“It’s a great honour to be driving a Ferrari in what is the 1000th Grand Prix for this, the longest serving of all Formula 1 teams,” said four-time world champion Vettel.

“It will be even more of a pleasure to celebrate this anniversary at the Mugello Circuit and also because, for the first time this season, a few spectators will be allowed into the grandstands.”

The Tuscan Grand Prix will be the first race of the 2020 season that fans are able to attend, with close to 3,000 tickets being made available for the event.

"I can't wait to be on track at Mugello with Ferrari,” said Leclerc. “The circuit is really beautiful and on top of that, we are celebrating our team’s 1000th GP in Formula 1. I’m also pleased to learn there will be a few thousand fans in the grandstands.”

As part of the celebrations, Ferrari junior driver Mick Schumacher will take part in a show run in a Ferrari F2004 - the car his father, Michael, won his record-setting seventh world title - ahead of the race on Sunday.

Ferrari will also hold an event in Florence on Saturday night to mark its 1000th grand prix.

Mercedes will also honour Ferrari’s 1000th race with a colour change of its own, changing the safety car from silver to red.

“The Tuscan Grand Prix will also be the 1000th F1 race for Ferrari, marking the long racing tradition of this great Italian brand,” said Mercedes F1 team principal Toto Wolff.

“We will honour this achievement with a Mercedes-AMG Safety Car in Ferrari red - our nod to a racing history that brought us some of the greatest moments in Formula 1.

“The men and women of Maranello have a proud history to celebrate and we're paying respect to those celebrations this weekend.”

DATE: 2020

The Italian outfit has fallen away from the front of the field in 2020, and faced a bruising outing in Belgium last weekend which was one of its least competitive showings for years.

The difficulties the team has faced in 2020, with its engine having lost power and its car too draggy, have prompted some to suggest that Ferrari needs change at the top.

But while Binotto knows he has complete support from Ferrari’s senior management, so was never worried by such talk, he has revealed that he did ponder his own position.

Asked in an interview with Corriere della Sera if he ever felt his position was in danger, Binotto said: "Honestly never, because I know I have the support of my managers. But I questioned myself. I thought about whether I was suitable for the role of team principal.”

Binotto said that he eventually concluded that he had what it takes to help turn things around for Ferrari, even though he accepted that he had perhaps not done everything perfectly.

“I could have done better in some areas, for example the technical reorganisation could have been done earlier,” he said. “But I believe that my 25 years in F1, and the knowledge of this company, are key elements to do well in this job.”

Ferrari reshuffled its technical structure earlier this year so that Binotto could step away from his heavy involvement in that area and better concentrate on areas that needed more time devoted to them.

Allied to the discussions over framing a new Concorde Agreement, Binotto said that perhaps he had taken on too much – which had meant some aspects of the team had not got the attention they deserved.

"As team principal, the first role is not technical,” he said. “We worked on the renewal of Charles [Leclerc], on [Carlos] Sainz's recruitment and on many other fronts.

"It may be that in having less technical [focus] we were not sufficiently organised with delegating, but let's not forget that I became team principal without notice a year and a half ago. It takes time, all the winning cycles have shown this.

“When I think back to Ferrari in 1995 and 2000, many things changed. This reorganisation will not be the last.”

Binotto also says that while Ferrari CEO Louis Camilleri and chairman John Elkann have very different personalities to the late Sergio Marchionne, they are not as distant as some have suggested.

"It's one of the most wrong things I hear,” added Binotto. “I am not alone, I can assure you. I get their advice, surely their style of leadership is different from what we were used to in the past. But I am not alone. I am just not.”

DATE: 2020

Ferrari has endured a miserable start to the season that has seen the team slump to fifth place in the constructors' championship, sitting just two points clear of Renault.

Last weekend's Belgian Grand Prix  in 2020 as it spent just five laps running inside the top 10, with both Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel failing to score any points.

Ferrari is expecting to struggle once again this weekend at Monza given the high-speed nature of the circuit and its current straight-line speed deficit.

The team has made no secret of the task it faces to turn things around, with

Ricciardo's name has been repeatedly linked to a seat at Ferrari in recent years, but will join McLaren for 2021 to replace Carlos Sainz, who was snapped up by Ferrari to replace Sebastian Vettel.

Sainz has defended his decision to leave McLaren to move to Ferrari for next year despite the team's struggles, saying he is "100% sure" it was the right call.

Asked if he felt like he had dodged a bullet by not joining Ferrari given its current struggles, Ricciardo said that while he had not thought too deeply about it, he was surprised by how far it had fallen.

"It's tough to know really how long this string of results will last for the team," said Ricciardo. "I find it hard to see it lasting too long, but at the same time, I didn't expect to see the results or for them to struggle as much as I have, at least in Spa.

"It was talked about before the weekend that they were going to have a hard time, and it proved very much to be the case. They certainly are in a bit of a spot at the moment.

"I didn't really think that far ahead, if, what, how, why it would look [if I'd joined Ferrari]. From that point of view I can't really answer it. But I'm sure they will learn a lot from this year, and I'm sure they will pick themselves up in a better place for next year."

Ricciardo enjoyed his strongest race since joining Renault at the start of last year in Belgium, finishing fourth and picking up the bonus point for the fastest lap.

Teammate Esteban Ocon followed Ricciardo home in fifth place, marking Renault's biggest one-race points haul since returning to F1 as a works team in 2016.

Renault now sits just nine points of third place in the constructors' standings as it continues on an upward trajectory. But Ricciardo said there was no regret that he was helping the team move forward before leaving at the end of the year.

"Not at all," he said. "I'm certainly keen to keep this train moving, and try and stand on the steps this year.

"I'll put everything I can into it, and next year's another story."

Since the delayed start to the 2020 Formula 1 season in Austria at the start of July, all F1 races have been run behind closed doors without any spectators as part of the strict event protocols.

Plans are in place for close to 3,000 fans to attend the Tuscan Grand Prix at Mugello next week, which will be the first event where tickets are available for purchase. But it has been revealed that hundreds of fans will be in the grandstands at Monza this weekend as a token of thanks to the doctors and nurses who played a role in the fight against COVID-19.

Italy was one of the hardest-hit countries in Europe in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, with an estimated 35,000 deaths since the outbreak began. The 250 frontline workers will be guests of the Automobile Club d’Italia, which is the promoter of the Italian Grand Prix.

“Like all the other races run so far this year, the Italian Grand Prix will be held behind closed doors and therefore there will be no traditional track invasion by the fans at the end of the race,” stated Ferrari in its pre-race preview.

“However, there will be 250 very special people in the grandstands, socially distanced of course: doctors and nurses will be guests at the track, as a symbolic honour for their courage, sense of duty and altruism as front line workers in the fight against COVID-19.”

Ferrari is braced for a difficult home race weekend at Monza amid ongoing struggles with the SF1000 car that saw it fail to score any points in the Belgian Grand Prix last Sunday. Charles Leclerc took Ferrari’s first Italian Grand Prix victory in nine years last season, but said the team was set for a “difficult weekend” this time around.

“All the same, we are not lacking motivation for this round,” Leclerc said. “We will all pull together to bring home the best possible result.”

Teammate Sebastian Vettel added: “We come to Monza knowing it’s going to be tough to be a frontrunner this weekend. The last race here was anything but straightforward for me and we are well aware that will also be the case this time.

“We have a specific aero package that we hope will make the SF1000 more competitive. Nevertheless our aim this weekend is the same as always: to make the most of our package and bring home as many points as possible.”

McLaren moved up to third place in the constructors’ championship at last weekend’s Belgian Grand Prix after Lando Norris finished the race in seventh place.

The result lifted McLaren above Racing Point and extended its advantage over fifth-placed Ferrari, who failed to score any points and spent just five laps with a car inside the top 10.

Ferrari has struggled for form through 2020 so far amid aerodynamic issues with its SF1000 car and a lack of straight-line speed from its power unit.

With this weekend’s Italian Grand Prix set to be a difficult one for Ferrari-powered teams given the high-speed nature of the track, it gives McLaren an opportunity to widen the gap to the Italian marque in the constructors’ standings.

McLaren F1 chief Seidl is anticipating a tight fight with Racing Point and Renault at Monza, but said it was important not to write off Ferrari’s ability to fight back this year.

“I expect to be close again to the Racing Points and the Renaults,” Seidl said.

“Everything we can see here at the moment and take away from here, and also reading the comments from Ferrari, they may struggle there as well.

“So hopefully once again it is an opportunity to score more points than we did here. That gives us another good opportunity to score good points compared to some of the competitors that will be stronger again at other tracks.

“Something important and we never do [is] we cannot underestimate the ability of Ferrari to strike back during the course of the season because of their experience, the manpower, and the infrastructure.

“I am sure it is only a matter of time before they will strike back again as well. That’s why it hurts even more that we didn’t collect even more points [at Spa].”

McLaren currently sits seven points clear of Ferrari in the teams’ standings, with Renault a further two points behind Ferrari.

Seidl said he rued the fact McLaren had just one car in the race after Carlos Sainz was unable to take the start due to a power unit issue that caused an exhaust failure.

Despite a disappointing run to 14th on a weekend where Ferrari did not have much pace, Vettel was determined to do something special in his final outing for the Maranello team.

On his slow down lap after the chequered flag, as his team thanked him for all he had brought to the Maranello squad, he told them over the radio that he had a surprise.

In Italian he said: “You know that sometimes I like to sing, so I thought of singing one last time a song for you.”

Then, pulling out a sheet of paper with some lyrics that he had hidden in his cockpit, he sang to the tune of a famous Italian song from the 1960’s, Azzurro.

You’ll never surrender

I loved being with you

I felt your magic, an extraordinary feeling

Guys, I thank you, for having me

I will miss all of you

Greetings to all of you in Maranello,

You deserve to be mentioned here

And now I’ll say goodbye, and wish you all the best

I wish you to be happy but above all, to be healthy

Speaking after the race about why he chose to sign his Ferrari career off with a song, he said: “Obviously, I've had a lot of highs with the whole team, and every time I was really excited, for some reason I started to sing.

“So I think it was a nice way, for one last time, to sing again. And obviously the song that I leave them to is a very, very popular Italian song Azzurro from Adriano Celentano.

“I changed the lyrics, so I hope I don't get in trouble with copyright. But yeah, I think it was a good way to express the gratitude for the team."

Vettel had been given a tunnel of applause by his Ferrari crew as he left the garage for the last time ahead of the Abu Dhabi GP, and was later presented with a huge trophy from the team.

Speaking about that memento, he said: “I was surprised myself. Obviously I've never finished P14 before and got a trophy. So it will definitely be a good nice memory.

“There was also a sign at the front [of the garage] with all the wins. This year has been in a way a total reflection of the great time that I had with the team.”

Leclerc has adopted a largely white helmet colour scheme for the final race of the 2020 season, which mirrors the design Vettel has used throughout his six years at Ferrari – albeit with Monaco flag colours running over the top in place of the Germany equivalent his teammate uses.

The words ‘Danke, Seb’ are written on top of Leclerc’s helmet, which also features images of the two drivers, who have been teammates since the start of 2019 when Leclerc joined Ferrari from Sauber, during their time as colleagues at the Maranello marque.

Speaking after qualifying at the Yas Marina track, Leclerc explained to Motorsport.com why he had made the gesture.

“Seb has given so much to the team, which will benefit me indirectly because I’ve got a long contract with the team,” said Leclerc.

“And most of all, as soon as I arrived in the team, he welcomed me in the best way possible.

“Sure, there was some competition, but as a human being he is a great guy. So, I just wanted to show him my respect that way and I know he liked it.”

Vettel will start his final race for Ferrari – where he has scored 14 wins and 11 poles in what is expected to be a final race start total for the Scuderia of 118 – in P13.

"Obviously it is not nice to start my final race with the team from 13th on the grid,” he said after qualifying at the Yas Marina track.

“The result itself is quite bad, even if I was happy with my own performance on the lap.

“Maybe putting together the perfect lap would have got me as high as 10th, but no better than that.

“My plan for the race is simply to try and do my best. I guess we won’t have an easy race.

“I think it will be special since it is the last one.

“I want to enjoy this race and feel very close to the people in the garage, the mechanics, the engineers, everyone. It will be very emotional."

Leclerc, who also went into qualifying at the Yas Marina track with a three-place grid penalty hanging over his result thanks to his clash with Sergio Perez and Max Verstappen on the first lap of last weekend’s Sakhir GP, failed to recreate his best laps from Q1 and Q2 in the top 10 shootout.

The Monegasque driver did manage to get through on the advantageous medium tyres in Q2, but could not recreate his form on the softs in Q1 – where he was only behind the Mercedes duo, Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas, and ahead of eventual pole-winner, Verstappen.

When asked how vital it had been to progress through to Q3 on the mediums, which were lasting much longer than the red-walled softs on long runs in practice for the Abu Dhabi race, Leclerc told Motorsport.com that “it was important” before offering his thoughts on his Q3 form.

“I’m a bit disappointed because I wished we could do something more in Q3, which we didn’t,” he continued, after going 0.184s slower in the final segment than he had in Q1.

“We struggled a lot more in Q3 with tyre temperatures for some reason. So, we need to understand that, but happy to have gone through to Q3 with the medium.”

Leclerc explained that the problem was down to “keeping [the tyres] cool towards the end of the lap”.

He added: “We were struggling with overheating in the last sector and that made us lose quite a bit of laptime.”

Leclerc’s penalty means he will line up for the final race of the 2020 season in P12 on the grid, behind Renault duo Esteban Ocon and Daniel Ricciardo, who were eliminated in the middle phase of qualifying and are free to pick their starting race rubber.

“I don’t think it’s that bad at the end [to be starting behind the Renaults], because we would have chosen medium if we had free choice,” said Leclerc.

“So, luckily, we did a good job in Q2, which helps us to start on our preferred tyre.

“It would have been a lot more difficult [on be starting the softs] because… well, I could have had an advantage for two laps.

“But after that we all know that they are dropping quite a lot [with degradation].”

Vettel joined Ferrari in 2015, and finished runner-up to Lewis Hamilton in both 2017 and 2018. He also won 14 races for the team, putting him third in Maranello’s all-time list, behind title winners Michael Schumacher (72) and Niki Lauda (15).

Despite logging respectable statistics over his six years of an era dominated by Mercedes, Vettel says it wasn’t enough, having missed out on the big prize.

“It still doesn't change anything,” he said. “We've still failed. We had the ambition and target to win the championship. And we didn't, so I think it's just an honest reflection. I don't think saying it out loud changes anything.

“Probably we were up against a very strong team/driver combination, one of the strongest we've seen so far. But our goal was to be stronger than that. And in this regard, we have failed. Like I’ve said, there are reasons for it.

“We've had good races, bad races, we've got close, sometimes we're far away. There's a lot of reasons why, but in the big picture, I think it's not unfair, it's just the truth. Nothing wrong with saying it out loud.”

Vettel downplayed the impact of the pressure of representing Ferrari and living up the expectations of the tifosi.

“I don't know if I buy into the pressure thing, I think pressure you put on yourself,” he noted. “So as I said, I had the clear mission and target to win.

“I think I have obviously an emotional attachment to the team, growing up seeing Michael win, etcetera. So it was a very special moment when I joined the team.

“But the pressure thing, I think also the fact of the pressure in Italy, the fans and so on, yes, it is there. But ultimately I always set the highest sort of expectations on myself, and I think I was the first and best judge if I didn't achieve them.

“So rest assured that, when I stuffed the car in the gravel in Germany [in 2018], I wasn't happy before the tifosi weren't happy.

“I think it sounds nice, and it adds a little bit of drama to everything. But I'm definitely not holding that as an excuse for coming short here and there. I think if you are ambitious to win, and you have the target to win and to succeed, then you're the first one to realise that yourself, and it isn't depending on the pressure from outside.

“But having said that, everybody's different. But for me it wasn't the one thing holding us or holding me back.”

Vettel insisted that his Hockenheim accident in 2018 wasn’t a turning point in his relationship with the team.

“No, I think it was a pretty much a rollercoaster ride over the years with a lot of things happening. In terms of momentum in that year, it wasn't helping. The mistake was a little mistake, but a huge outcome, and a huge penalty.

“But there were definitely more things happening I think in the 2018 season. We've had the passing of Mr [Sergio] Marchionne, the change in leadership from Maurizio [Arrivabene] to Mattia [Binotto], so maybe the '18 year was a decisive year for many things.

“But I don't know if you can really break it down to only one thing. Obviously in 2016 we parted ways with James [Allison], because of personal conflicts at the time. And I think that looking back there were a lot of things that we should have and could have done better.

“But everything that happened happened for a reason. The main thing I think, on my side is to make sure that I learned from it, and I think I have grown with it, somewhere, moments on the track, like you mentioned in Germany or Hockenheim. Other moments were off the track.

“So overall, I think I feel much more comfortable or in a better place now than than those years ago, but certainly at the time, it hasn't always been been easy and straightforward.”htforward.”

Vettel vented his frustration over team radio over Leclerc’s move at the first corner following the second standing start in Bahrain on Sunday, feeling he was not left enough room.

Following a pass up the inside by Leclerc, Vettel said on team radio: “Not again! He can't just do that, as if I wasn't there.

“It's the same as Austria, seriously. This time, I should have crashed, maybe [that] was the better option.”

A move by Leclerc on the opening lap of the Styrian Grand Prix resulted in contact between the two Ferrari drivers, forcing both to retire from the race.

Leclerc went on to score a point for 10th place in Bahrain, while Vettel finished 13th after reporting that his car felt undriveable at times.

Leclerc and Vettel confirmed after the race in Bahrain that they had spoken about the incident, with Leclerc feeling it was a different situation to Austria.

“We spoke about it,” said Leclerc. “On my side, the only thing I can say is that surely it was extremely tight, but on the other hand, not like in Styria, where I didn’t put myself in a visible place.

“This time I tried to go further for him to see me. There was very little gap, but I went for it, and I made sure that he saw me.

“You can argue there was probably not enough gap between our cars being in the same team, but yeah, that’s it.”

Vettel said that Ferrari “don’t need to make a big deal out of it”, feeling he and Leclerc can move on quickly.

“Obviously it was tight,” Vettel said. “Arguably if you have three cars in the first corner, then at times, it works, and most of the time it doesn't work.

“We spoke about it so we can move on, it’s not a big deal.”

After enjoying its best two-car result of the season in Turkey two weeks earlier by finishing third and fourth, Ferrari slumped to the rear of the midfield in Bahrain as it struggled to compete for points.

Ferrari sporting director Laurent Mekies felt its downturn in form was not a result of its engine power deficit, instead citing the warmer conditions compared to recent races as a possible factor.

“I don’t think it’s all down to engine power at all,” Mekies said. “It’s true that compared to the last three or four races, we have lost some edge in the midfield, and if you lose a bit of edge, it’s enough to switch from extremes.

“It’s been painful from that perspective. If you consider the whole environment, we are certainly very different to what we have been facing in the last three or four races in Europe with colder, wet weather.

“Hopefully there is a way to unlock a bit more compared to what we’ve done this weekend, that’s what we’ll be trying again next week.”

Vettel qualified 11th at the Bahrain International Circuit on Saturday night, narrowly missing out on a place in Q3 after struggling on his final lap.

It marked the 11th race in a row where Vettel has failed to make it through to Q3, with the German sounding frustrated over team radio upon learning of the result.

But Vettel did manage to outqualify Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc, who could only finish 12th overall.

"It was very tough and tight," Vettel said. "I think Sector 2 wasn't ideal, I was too close to George [Russell], maybe that didn't help, and I was struggling after the stop and go in the final sector to get the fronts really to work.

"Maybe there was a little bit more [time], so Sector 2 was for sure not super clean. Overall I think it's more or less where we belong this weekend.

"Tomorrow is the race, and in the race it's not about one lap, so we'll see what we can do."

Drivers have been struggling with tyre management throughout the Bahrain weekend so far, prompting all of the top 10 to decide to qualify on the medium compound tyre.

Vettel said there would be a big "tyre battle" for Ferrari, meaning it had to be canny with its strategy if it wished to score points.

"This track is very rough, very tough on tyres, and that will be the key tomorrow to manage those," Vettel said.

"I think if we are sly as a fox, we have a good chance. If not, then it will be a long race. I still believe that there is a good chance to score some points."

Leclerc felt there was "definitely a bit more" time to find during his lap after ailing to his second straight Q2 exit.

"You can always do better, but I think that's the case for everyone," Leclerc said.

"At Turn 4 I think I lost quite a bit, but yeah, it's like this, we'll start P11 and P12, the first ones to have a free tyre choice.

"I don't know how much we can benefit from that, because I'm pretty sure that starting on the medium for the top 10 is not so bad.

"But yeah, we did our best, and today that's what was possible."
