Gasly took a surprise win for AlphaTauri at Monza in September after a red flag and a penalty for leader Lewis Hamilton shook up the pecking order.

Gasly was able to move into the lead once Hamilton served his penalty before fending off McLaren’s Carlos Sainz in the closing stages to take a famous win.

The result marked only the second victory in the history of the AlphaTauri team, and made him the first driver not racing for the ‘big three’ of Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull to win a race since Kimi Raikkonen in 2013.

Some of the most striking images from the race came during the podium ceremony, where Gasly sat on the top step as he came to terms with the enormity of his achievement.

The events of the Monza race and celebrations that followed are still strong in Gasly’s mind, even if the Frenchman felt it had been difficult to truly realise its significance due to the hectic 2020 F1 schedule.

“I remember every single second of that race and of the celebration,” Gasly told Motorsport.com. It’s something which is in my mind and will never go away.

“I would say this year was so compact and intense that it was actually hard to really take the time off, and get to relax and enjoy as much as probably I would have done in a more normal scenario without COVID.

“Still, when I had a week’s break between two races and I could get back home and I could realise, ‘OK, that’s what we’ve done', and really try to think over and remember all of the emotions that we lived.

“It was something quite incredible. This year, Mercedes won pretty much all the races, except Max [Verstappen] and Checo [Perez] - and us. So it was really something incredible.”

Gasly revealed that he keeps the winner’s trophy from the race at his apartment as a source of motivation, but felt the result had empowered the entire AlphaTauri team.

"When I’m in Italy in my apartment, that's where I stayed over the [Monza] weekend, it was the first time to sleep at home for a race weekend,” said Gasly.

“I’m sat exactly there, the same place I had my breakfast before my win, and I see the trophy and kind of feels pretty special.

“It’s a great motivation. Every morning, I take my coffee with the trophy in front of me, and think ‘yeah, we’ve done it’. It’s not impossible, even though we were a midfield team.

“That should be a motivation for all of us in the team to try and repeat as much as we can, strong performances like we have had in Sao Paulo or in Monza.”

DATE: 2020

Kvyat is expected to be replaced at AlphaTauri by Red Bull and Honda junior driver Yuki Tsunoda in 2021 after the Japanese driver finished third in this year’s F2 championship.

AlphaTauri has not made any official announcement about Kvyat’s future, but the Russian driver has openly said he is already targeting a return to F1 in 2022.

Asked by Motorsport.com in the Abu Dhabi paddock if he thought he had made his last appearance, Kvyat said he wanted to “do vacation” and “then we’ll see for 2022”.

“I'll try to come back, because I feel like in the right ambience with the right people around me in the right car, which I like,” Kvyat said.

“I can be extremely competitive, and I still feel like I have a lot to give. I am grateful of course for everything, for all these years. It was great, great stint, these last two years with the team. That is fantastic. They are amazing.

“But it's a shame that I am not even able to say if I'm there or not next year.

“It's a bit funny, I'm talking here with you. And they still kind of didn't give me the official news. That’s about it.”

Kvyat has raced for AlphaTauri for the past two seasons in what is his third separate stint with the team.

He made his debut with its predecessor, Toro Rosso, in 2014 before moving to Red Bull one season later, only to be sent back to Toro Rosso four races into the 2016 season.

He was then dropped completely by the Red Bull programme at the end of 2017, only to then return in 2019 with Toro Rosso.

Asked if he felt his time with Red Bull was finally over, Kvyat said: “You can never say never.

“Life teaches you to never say never to anything. But of course, I think we've been on off quite a long time now.

“I had a contract for these two years. That was the deal. That's it. And for the rest, ask Helmut [Marko].”

Kvyat clarified that he was “a free agent now” and was open to any options for 2021, but hinted he could take a year out of racing.

“I’m open to many ideas, I don't say no to anything right now,” Kvyat said. Next year, I think racing-wise, perhaps I would like a year off. But we will see.

“If something really extremely good will come up, of course I'll think about saying yes.

“Otherwise, we'll try to focus us to come back to come back in Formula 1 in 2022.”

DATE: 2020

Sato, 21, moved up to F2 full-time in 2020 with Trident after six appearances for Campos the previous year, having also won the Euroformula Open title the previous year.

The Japanese driver picked up one point across the 12-round season, finishing eighth in the Mugello sprint race.

Sato will link up with AlphaTauri for next Tuesday’s young driver test in Abu Dhabi, partnering Yuki Tsunoda in the team’s two-car entry for the running.

“I am extremely happy to be given this opportunity from AlphaTauri to drive an F1 car,” Sato said.

“We will try to do as many laps as possible to get used to the car quickly and to learn maximum out of it for whatever it comes in future.

“Obviously to be driving an F1 car is the dream of every racing driver, for sure I will enjoy a lot around Abu Dhabi!”

AlphaTauri team principal Franz Tost said he was pleased to welcome Sato to the team for the running, feeling it was a deserved test after a “solid job” in F2 this year.

“We are convinced he can do a good job as he is a skilled driver,” Tost said.

“The plan for the test is simple, getting him to do as many laps as possible to give him a good feeling for an F1 car. This test will be very useful, both for us and for Marino and we will do our best to help him understand how an F1 team operates in all its different aspects.

“In addition, from a technical point of view he will certainly learn something from which he will benefit next year, when he will continue in the F2 championship.

“I think this is a very good preparation for his future and it’s a pleasure to be part of his development towards what we hope will be a very successful career.”

Sato is currently taking part in F2 post-season testing in Bahrain with Trident before heading to Abu Dhabi for the F1 running.

Teams are permitted to enter two cars to the Abu Dhabi test, although not all will partake in what was initially slated to be a day solely for young drivers.

The FIA has since opened up the test to any driver who did not race full-time in F1 this year, allowing .

DATE: 2020

The Frenchman remains concerned that he could suffer a repeat in the race as several teams struggled over the kerbs in the bumpy linking section of the outer circuit.

Gasly was an impressive third in Saturday’s FP3 session, and was then fifth in Q1.

However, he couldn’t maintain that momentum through the rest of qualifying after a heavy kerb strike cost him downforce, and ultimately he had to settle for ninth place, three spots behind teammate Daniil Kvyat.

“A bit mixed feeling,” he said. “Obviously after the pace we showed in P3 it was a bit frustrating, because I damaged the floor in Q1, and from there basically we tried to repair as much as we could.

“From Q2 it was pretty difficult. We had another hit in Q2. I’ve lost some parts of the floor, bargeboards, and it just made life really hard, so I was happy to make it to Q3 already.

“I think we were right on the edge, but a bit disappointed because obviously after what we showed I knew the car had more potential, and we were just stuck with this damage we keep having in Turn 8, on the exit kerb.”

Gasly was relieved to have qualified as high as ninth.

“In the end it was more about damage limitation, and I think that’s what we managed to achieve. So I think I’m still happy I made it to Q3, and we’re starting P9 I think is not bad.”

Gasly is confident of a strong race, although he's concerned about the fragility of the car.

“Actually I hope for some good points. I’ve been feeling strong in the car the whole weekend, long run pace we’re good, so I know in terms of pace we’ll have a good fight with the guys around us.

“And the main thing is just reliability where I’m a bit worried, because since yesterday we keep losing parts of the car, like we lost the mirrors, bargeboards were damaged, floor as well in P2, and then again in quali.

“So that’s the only thing that we need to be careful of, because 87 laps, it will be a very long race, and we've got to keep the car in one piece. But if we do so I’m confident we can have a good afternoon and score some good points.”

DATE: 2020

The AlphaTauri driver was swiped by Grosjean on the run out of the opening corner sequence in Bahrain, and that impact turned the Haas car right into the crash barriers.

Grosjean’s car then split in two as it went through the guardrail, erupting in flames as the Frenchman had to move quickly to get himself out of the fire.

He was flown by helicopter to hospital with light burns and suspected broken ribs from the impact.

Kvyat said that he had been initially upset about the way Grosjean had hit him, but said it all changed when he saw what happened behind him.

“[It] was a scary moment,” Kvyat told Sky. “I saw him [and] at first I was very angry that he came across like this. I thought "What is he doing?"

“But then my mind changed immediately when I saw in the mirrors the fire. I was just hoping he was okay.

“I immediately didn't like what I saw in my mirrors and we're glad... I'm glad he's okay. Honestly. Really, this just reminds you what we do is dangerous.”

Kvyat was involved in another incident at Turn 8 when the race restarted, as he tangled with Racing Point’s Lance Stroll – tipping the Canadian upside down.

The race stewards handed him a 10-second stop-go penalty for his part in the crash, something which he did not think was fair.

“I don't share the stewards view on that,” said Kvyat. “I think I had nowhere to go.

“I already put my whole car on the inside kerb. He on the other hand, he knew I was in there, but he turned in as if I wasn't there. So I'm a bit upset with this decision.

“It kind of ruined my race, because I had a great second start, I was again back in the game, but this penalty just ruined everything.”

Stroll escaped unhurt from the incident, saying it looked much worse on television than it was from the cockpit.

However, he said he saw nothing of what happened, as he felt he had turned in normally.

“Yeah, I mean, I didn't see anything,” he said. “I couldn't see him at all. I was halfway through the corner when I got hit. So yeah. It's just a shame.

“You know, we've scored two points since Monza, and there was a time where we were, you know, fourth in the world championship and things were looking really good.

“Since then, it's just been a disaster. So, I don't know what else to add. We just have to focus on the next one and try and put an end to this run of bad luck and, yeah, move forward from this.”

With Pierre Gasly already confirmed in the other seat, Kyvat’s place at the Faenza team is looking uncertain. F2 star Yuki Tsunoda is widely expected to be promoted, while Alex Albon is also potentially in the mix if he’s dropped by Red Bull Racing.

However, Kvyat says that he’s already heard from potential employers in other categories, and his manager Nicolas Todt is looking at options.

“People are calling me for sure quite a bit,” he said. “And for sure, there is a lot of interest from everything, from many places, but right now I know that I will be able to choose what I can do next year anyway.

“My deal was with AlphaTauri, Toro Rosso at the time, that I do 2019 and 2020. And that's it. And then we will see. However, after Abu Dhabi, regardless of anyone's decision, I'm deciding what I'm doing with my life, with my career.

“We'll see what it's gonna be, I still don't know. For sure there is interest from other people. I received calls, and it's good. It's always very nice to have interesting options. And it never hurts.

“So I'm definitely in touch with people, Nicolas is in touch with people. So it can become a very interesting thing in the future. So like I said, I'm open to many things, and I don't have any particular preferences at the moment. I am still focusing on these races here.”

Asked if he would accept a Red Bull/AlphaTauri reserve role, he said: “I don't know. I haven't thought about it yet. I haven't thought about these kind of things. So we'll see what will be on the table after the end of the year, first of all.

“And then you look at all the things and you pick what suits you the best, what you think you will be able to do the best job possible in a way.

“There is still nothing to think about yet, about these kinds of things. But of course, I'm not saying no to anything before it even comes.”

Kyvat admitted that one possibility is to take a year out and reflect, .

“I said that I have options. And one of the options is also just to have a proper holiday year, doing something else. Just enjoy other things, other things that I didn't do while I was in F1.

“I'm confident I can be competitive in anything. So whatever I drove usually, from day one,everyone was saying to me, ‘Wow, you're really competitive, even if it's a completely different thing to F1.’

“I had a full year off in 2018, and I barely drove anything. And then I came back to Abu Dhabi in the test, I did 160 laps and I was straight away very competitive also. So I'm also not too worried about that.”

Gasly made it home in 13th, a place behind Kvyat, after both drivers struggled all day to find pace in the tricky conditions.

AlphaTauri’s hopes of challenging Ferrari for sixth place in the world championship also took a hit as the Maranello-based outfit logged 27 points with third and fourth places.

Gasly’s day started badly when the FIA launched an investigation after the team changed its mind having been given permission to change the power unit.

The stewards decreed that as the team had worked on the car, it was a parc ferme infringement, and Gasly thus had to start from the back of the grid.

“Not only today, the whole weekend was really bad,” he said. “So we had a very poor performance in the wet. And honestly it's a bit embarrassing, because we were just so slow with the wets, with the inters, we can't switch them on. It was the same in quali.

“And we took a penalty. So a lot of problems. And we need to do better, because honestly, it was a poor performance from our side since yesterday morning. And we'll have to work for the next races.

“I mean, it obviously was very unique conditions, that I don't expect we're going to face, but just for all of us, I think we need to understand what went wrong, and what didn't work.

“So we already have some answers from yesterday [qualifying]. But we cannot make the changes for today.

"Still, we should have anticipated all these things, and I think we could have done a better job. But now it's done, and we need to look at the next three races.”

Kvyat was one of the three drivers to complete the race on a one-stop strategy after being eliminated in Q1 on Saturday, but still finished a lap down in 12th.

“I was a bit frustrated to finish P12, because it's like no points and so much struggle,” said the Russian. “Fighting the car all race and finishing with no reward is a bit frustrating.

“There's not much to do to be honest. Our pace this weekend in these conditions, somehow the car wasn't in the right window. So we need to analyse why.

“But it's also understandable, these conditions you find extremely rarely, so it wouldn't be correct to build a car around these kind of conditions. But we just need to learn from it. And understand.”

If the team is found to have broken the parc ferme rules a possible outcome could be a pitlane start.

Gasly initially qualified 15th, although he gained two places when McLaren drivers .

It’s understood that for tactical reasons the team decided to undertake a complete change of PU elements and start at the back of the grid.

Such a change would give Gasly enough elements to get through the rest of the season without a further grid penalty.

The team requested the change on Saturday evening following qualifying - just after the Sainz penalty was announced but before that of Norris was confirmed - and permission was granted by technical delegate Jo Bauer.

Under parc ferme rules usually changes are only allowed if the team can demonstrate that there is a technical issue, and that any replacement parts are of the same spec. However it’s generally understood that doesn’t apply to PU elements.

Work began in the garage on Saturday evening. However, on Sunday morning the team told Bauer that it didn’t want to change the PU after all. After apparently reviewing race strategies it decided that it wasn’t worth sacrificing Gasly's 13th place.

Intriguingly Bauer has pointed out to the stewards that this suggests that the request for a change was not due to a “physical issue” but “strategic reasons.”

He also stressed the fact that the rear was off the car meant that the FIA could not confirm that other changes had not been made.

In his report Bauer said: “Yesterday the Scuderia AlphaTauri Honda team requested to change all PU elements on car number 10 for new ones. This request was approved at 18:55 on 14 September [sic] 2020, following a written request from the team concerned, this being in accordance with Article 34.2 of the 2020 F1 Sporting Regulations.

“The team started to take the car apart and the car was on high stands over night due to the work already carried out (gearbox removed, ICE removed, radiators removed etc.). This morning the team has withdrawn the request which allows an assumption that the change was requested for strategic reasons and not for physical ones.

“More importantly the car was already disassembled to a stage where it is impossible for the scrutineers and the other supervision means in place to guarantee that no modification to the car has been carried to any component by disassembling and refitting the original items.

“For the above mentioned reasons I am referring this matter to the stewards for their consideration.”

DATE: 2020

Vips, 20, has been part of the Red Bull junior programme since the end of 2018, and had been due to race in Super Formula this year, only for travel restrictions to complicate his plans.

Vips has instead made appearances in both F2 and the Formula Regional European Championship, and will now serve as Red Bull’s reserve driver in Istanbul this weekend.

Red Bull announced on Twitter that Vips had completed the required 300km in an F1 car to gain an FIA superlicence, meaning he would be eligible to race if required.

Vips will deputise for regular Red Bull and AlphaTauri reserves Sebastian Buemi and Sergio Sette Camara, both of whom are tied up with other commitments this weekend. Buemi is racing for Toyota in the FIA World Endurance Championship season finale in Bahrain.

Vips currently has 32 superlicence points to his name accrued through junior categories, but benefits from the recent changes to the FIA requirements that allow drivers with more than 30 points to be eligible if their programmes were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Vips is yet to make an appearance in Super Formula this year, with Red Bull appearing to have abandoned plans for him to feature in the Japanese series.

Vips joined DAMS in F2 as a replacement for the injured Sean Gelael from the Spa round onwards, and has scored 16 points in eight races, including a podium at the Mugello sprint race.

With Gelael set to return from his back injury for the round in Bahrain later this month, it is unclear if Vips will have any more racing duties through 2020.

He has not raced in the Formula Regional European Championship since the Mugello round last month, having scored three podiums in nine races this year.

DATE: 2020

The Russian executed a brilliant restart after the late safety car period at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, making full use of his soft tyres to move up from seventh to fourth in just half a lap.

He not only got his getaway spot on by moving past Sergio Perez and Alex Albon on the run down to the first chicane, but also executed a decisive move around Leclerc at Piratella to give himself a shot of a podium finish.

Speaking to Motorsport.com about the secrets to his restart, Kvyat said he knew immediately before the racing got underway again that he could not hesitate in making his moves.

“I knew I had a bit of a warm up advantage over those guys with the hard tyres, and I had to use it immediately otherwise they would warm their tyres up,” the AlphaTauri driver explained.

“So I basically just tried to get as good an exit as possible out of last corner, and get the good slipstream.

“I saw that Sergio was hesitating a bit where to go and then he went to the right. I said: ‘okay, I'll take more slipstream out of Alex's car and try and go to the left.’

“I was hoping he wouldn't make any strange moves because it could be very like costly at that speed. It was very tight and there was not a lot of space in there, but I managed to have a good braking into Turn One.”

After getting past Perez and Albon, Kvyat set about closing down and getting past Leclerc, knowing he had to pounce quickly if he was going to capitalise on his tyre advantage.

And while the high-speed Piratella corner is not an obvious place for overtaking, Kvyat said he could not waste the opportunity that came up as he picked up the Ferrari slipstream on the climb out of Tosa

“Sometimes you have to invent things a bit,” he said about the decisive Leclerc move. “I knew that he [Leclerc] didn't have as much confidence as me, because his tyres were colder. And I said, ‘let's see how he's going to react.’

“I had a good run out of Tosa. I tried to prepare as good an exit as possible out of there, and I got a good traction.

“I used a bit of boost and good slipstream. It was a very short slipstream, but good. And then I just tried to brake a bit later than him. I saw that he braked earlier than me and I thought if I leave him enough space on the inside, I'll make it. That's exactly what happened. And also, you can trust certain drivers a bit with these kind of things.”

Kvyat’s move past Leclerc put him in touch with Renault’s Daniel Ricciardo, who was running third at the time.

But his chances of challenging the Renault diminished as Kvyat needed to recharge his battery pack, plus his Australian rival was able to get his hard tyres up to temperature.

“I had used quite a lot of battery by that point,” he said. “So when I got to Daniel, I had to start a bit more charging, and there were a couple of laps where I had to wait.

“Then I started putting pressure on him again, but he managed to warm up his tyres while I was battling with other guys. The Renault has good straight line speed as well and it was a tough one. Maybe with more laps, it could have been possible.”

Even though Kvyat ran out of laps to overtake Ricciardo and take a podium finish, he still says his fourth place was a good result as AlphaTauri aims to close in on Ferrari in the constructors’ championship.

“When I was crossing the line, I wasn't putting my hand in the air or anything like that, because I was still pretty focused on Daniel and trying to get him,” he said.

“Of course, then a few metres after, I also thought about it and it was a strong race. Then I was happy, of course, with the result.

“I looked back at my overtakes after the restart, and it was good feeling.”

DATE: 2020

Red Bull junior and Formula 2 racer Tsunoda took another step towards a potential F1 drive in 2021 by completing his first F1 test for AlphaTauri at Imola, driving a 2018-spec Toro Rosso STR13 car.

The running only adds to the growing momentum building for Tsunoda to partner Italian GP winner Pierre Gasly at AlphaTauri next season as a replacement for Daniil Kvyat. Tsunoda completed more than the 300km of running required for an FIA superlicence, but also requires a top-five finish in F2 this season to qualify for a superlicence in 2021.

After testing in damp conditions in the morning, Tsunoda was able to complete some dry running in the afternoon, managing both qualifying hot laps and race simulation runs. Reflecting on his first day of F1 testing, Tsunoda said that while the car itself was easier to drive than he anticipated, it was also more physically challenging.

“It was easier for the driving, but also harder physically,” said Tsunoda. “I expected it to be a little bit less hard physically, especially on the neck. Because driving in Formula 2, I don’t feel much on my neck, and my neck is pretty strong.

“After I drove a Formula 1 car today, I felt it pretty hard, especially in the braking zone and the braking performance. The braking power is more than I expected. I need a lot of training until maybe the next session and next event to drive a Formula 1 car and prepare.”

Tsunoda also said the power of the F1 car was big step up from what he was used to in F2, where he has scored two wins and sits third in the championship in his first year in the category.

“After I put the throttle, I initially feel the big power from the engine which I don’t feel much in Formula 2,” said Tsunoda. “I think that power is more than I expected, and that was, even in the rain, it was really, really big performance for the initial struggle. Even in rainy conditions, I think it was more [performance] than I felt in Formula 2 dry conditions. That was the biggest surprise for today.”

Tsunoda was able to draw on his experiences in Red Bull’s simulator to get used to the complex steering wheel and various settings on the F1 car, but was pleased with how he managed it by the end of the day.

“The experience from practicing in the simulator in Red Bull helped me a lot to get used to it really quickly, and the end of the session was really consistently fast,” he said. “Even in race sim, the lap times were really consistent, even while I’m doing lots of things on the steering every lap, almost every single corner. That was a good step for me.”

Tsunoda is widely expected to appear in an F1 practice session with AlphaTauri before the end of the season, and is already confirmed to be taking part in the end-of-year young driver test in Abu Dhabi.
