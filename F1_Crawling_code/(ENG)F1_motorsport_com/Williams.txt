Williams had been , with his family confirming he was in a stable condition, while keeping the details of his medical situation private.

Earlier on Thursday the 78-year-old’s former team, which he founded in junior single-seater categories in 1966, announced Williams had been released from hospital to continue his recovery at home.

“We're delighted to say that Sir Frank has been discharged from hospital and is now on the mend at home,” a Williams statement read. “The Williams family would like to thank everyone for their support during this difficult time, and to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.”

We're delighted to say that Sir Frank has been discharged from hospital and is now on the mend at home.The Williams family would like to thank everyone for their support during this difficult time, and to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

Williams ended his association with the team that bears his name in September this year, soon after its acquisition by Dorilton Capital, with daughter Claire Williams also stepping down from her role as deputy team principal.

Last week Williams announced former McLaren F1 boss and Volkswagen Motorsport head Jost Capito is set to arrive at the Grove-based team as its new CEO, starting his position next February, with Simon Roberts taking on the role of team principal on a permanent basis.

Roberts is adamant Williams will remain a wholly independent team to continue “the cultural fit with the team” started by it founder as it looks to start a new era in 2021.

"We can see advantages but we don't want to become a B-team," he explained. "We want to retain our independence, but we want to be more competitive. So for us, looking forward, we're open to extending a relationship but the specification of that would depend on what we think we're strong at, internally, and where we think we need help and support.

"From the cultural fit with the team, there's a lot of synergy between the road map that Claire [Williams] had laid out and we're staying very true to that.”

Sir Frank Williams suffered severe injuries in a road accident in France in 1986, which rendered him tetraplegic, but continued to run the team in spite of his injuries and, along with co-founder Sir Patrick Head, Williams was a powerhouse team of the 1980s and 1990s. For his services to the sport, he was knighted in 1999.

Russell raced for Mercedes at the Sakhir Grand Prix after seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton tested positive for COVID-19, and came close to scoring his maiden F1 victory before eventually finishing ninth.

As Mercedes waited to learn whether Hamilton could race in Abu Dhabi, Russell took part in Thursday's media duties for the team, only for it to be confirmed later in the day that he would be returning to Williams for the rest of the weekend.

Russell conceded that he had mixed feelings upon hearing he would be going back to Williams for the race, having wanted to put together a full weekend for Mercedes with greater preparation.

"It was a strange feeling, to be honest," Russell said.

"Prior to Bahrain, I really wanted to have the two weeks in the car, purely because I was expecting to learn everything I needed to in Bahrain and I could have come here with no excuses, as such.

"As Bahrain did go so well from a performance perspective, part of me was like you know what, I think it was a good weekend, obviously I really wanted to win and I would have had a great opportunity this weekend.

"But nevertheless, these guys at Williams, they gave me that opportunity, they've been working so hard for me over the last two years.

"It's my duty to send off the season on a high, and that's what I'm here to do."

Russell got back into the Williams FW43 car for practice on Friday at the Yas Marina Circuit, and ended the day 2.5 seconds slower than pace-setter Valtteri Bottas in the Mercedes.

The 22-year-old said it was "very different" driving the Williams once again due to the shift in pace.

"There's no hiding the laptimes, obviously that's clear," Russell said.

"Mercedes is the benchmark. I was fortunate enough to race for them last week and know where we need to be pushing the car.

"It's good learning, and to get that back-to-back in the space of five days was great."

Russell was able to score his first F1 points in Sakhir with Mercedes, but was unsure of repeating the feat with Williams in the season finale barring setbacks for the cars further up the order.

"We'll be trying our everything," Russell said. "I think it gets to the last race of the season, I think everybody up and down the grid gets a bit desperate.

"There are a few teams fighting over that P3 spot, so we might see some big lunges. Carlos [Sainz Jr.] is off to Ferrari, so he probably won't care if he bashes up the car, then you've got Danny Ric [Ricciardo] is off, so he probably doesn't care if he bashes up the car.

"Who else is going? Sergio [Perez]'s off, so he won't care if he bashes up the car. It could be a good one.

"But on pure pace, we know we won't be fighting for the top 10, in all honesty. Kimi [Raikkonen] looked really fast, and Kevin [Magnussen], but that's usually the case.

"We're usually a bit off on Friday, and we usually sort it out on Saturday."

Russell was loaned out by Williams to Mercedes for last weekend’s race, with the Briton being chosen as the replacement for Lewis Hamilton who was absent because of coronavirus.

After qualifying on the front row, Russell led away at the start and looked on course for the victory before a botched pitstop by Mercedes and a late puncture cost him a shot at the win.

Russell’s move to Mercedes led to Williams drafting in reserve driver Jack Aitken, who delivered a solid showing all weekend despite a spin in the race that triggered the safety car.

But with Russell’s absence leaving Williams with two rookies in Nicholas Latifi and Aitken, head of vehicle performance Dave Robson said that the team noticed the difference of their regular star man not being there.

“There's no doubt we missed George, not just because of his pace but his guidance on the car and the tyres particularly,” explained Robson.

“So, yeah, not easy. The value of experience is enormous and for sure it's been a little bit harder than it could have been. But, I think, to be fair [to Latifi and Aitken], the two of them have done a good job.”

One of the reasons that Mercedes opted for Russell was that it felt it would be hugely beneficial for the youngster to have the experience of racing for a front line team.

Such knowledge could then be taken back to Williams, which would help both his own and the team’s development potential.

Robson thinks there will be some upside to what Russell will bring back with him, but he has downplayed it being anything that could help transform the Williams package.

“I guess we'll find out over the next couple of weeks when we talk to him again, but there's nothing that he's going to be able to say that will suddenly turn our car into theirs,” he said.

“There'll be quite a limit on what's directly relevant. There's a limit to what they'll tell him, and a limit to what would be reasonable for him to then pass on to us.

“But in any case, I think a lot of the specifics are not that relevant. That car [the Mercedes] is so different to ours clearly that it won't be that relevant.

“But it'll be interesting. He will have gained some valuable experience on how they prepare their tyres, how they do race starts. And whilst it may not be directly relevant, he should at least be able to pick up some of the ideas that they use to work that out.

“At the very least, it's a different experience for him, which is good, and hopefully the experience of racing at the sharp end will help him in his confidence and his understanding of what racing in F1 is about at the moment.”

Aitken was drafted in by Williams as replacement for George Russell, who has been loaned out to Mercedes to stand in for Lewis Hamilton.

Having instantly got up to speed in Sakhir Grand Prix practice, Aitken was faster than teammate Nicholas Latifi in the first two runs in qualifying, before being pipped by less than one tenth of a second on their last effort.

Williams has seen enough, however, to already be impressed by the job Aitken has done in integrating himself so quickly at the team.

Dave Robson, Williams’ head of vehicle performance, said: “Jack's done a good job all weekend.

“We had him in the car [for free practice] in Austria, for the second race, so we knew he was comfortable and fitted, and there were no basic issues.

“All his kit was out here, because we were going to run him at the young driver's test [in Abu Dhabi], so it was actually all pretty seamless to be honest once we had it all confirmed.

“It was quick check with him and he spent a couple of days to embed himself with George's race engineering team. Otherwise seamless and good. A good productive couple of days I think. He did very well.”

Robson said that the way Aitken kept Latifi on his toes this weekend was positive, and he felt that the Canadian had actually got close to making it through to Q2.

“I think Nicholas was probably a little bit frustrated with himself because actually his final lap there was really, really good,” added Robson.

“He made a mistake in the last corner, and was actually pretty close. He could have got into Q2, I think. I'm sure he would have liked to beat him [Aitken] more comprehensively I guess, as that's what racing drivers are like.

“I think it's been fairly close all weekend. I think Jack's had a bit of a tough season in F2, but we knew from Austria and from his career record before that he's definitely no mug. So I think it's credit to Jack he's come in and done a very good job.”

Campos Formula 2 driver Aitken will make his first grand prix start on Sunday in Bahrain after being .

Russell is replacing Lewis Hamilton for the weekend after the seven-time world champion tested positive for COVID-19 on Monday.

Mercedes struck a deal with Williams to release Russell for this weekend’s Sakhir Grand Prix, paving the way for reserve driver Aitken to step into the Williams seat.

“It’s been a busy 48 hours or so, but I’m happy now everything is sorted,” Aitken said.

“I can just focus on getting the job done. I’m really excited.”

Aitken revealed that once news of Hamilton’s positive test emerged and Russell became an option for Mercedes, he was quick to get in touch with Williams about the seat.

“Such was my impatience that I actually contacted the team and said, what’s going on?” Aitken revealed.

“That was on Tuesday afternoon, and they just said, ‘we’re assessing the situation, we’ll get back to you, just sit tight’.

“So I sat tight for several hours, and was like, come on! Eventually, it stretched out overnight and in the morning on Wednesday, confirmation came through.

“It was announced half an hour later or something. It all happened quite quickly.”

Motorsport.com understands that Aitken was always going to get the Williams drive in the event of Russell moving up to Mercedes, with no consideration being given to other drivers such as Stoffel Vandoorne and Nico Hulkenberg.

Friday’s running in Bahrain will mark Aitken’s second time in the Williams FW43 car following his appearance in practice for the Styrian Grand Prix earlier this year.

After completing another seat fit and adjustment on Wednesday, Aitken said the car was “feeling pretty good”.

“I did FP1 in Austria, so it was just a case of checking everything was as I remember it,” Aitken said.

“We have the luxury of a lot more time to get prepared and settled in, so it’s been pretty smooth so far.

“The goal for the team hasn’t changed. We want to be trying to get up into the fight with the midfield runners, and hopefully if there’s a bit of chaos and luck, hopefully some points.

“We’re all going to be pushing for that, the same as always.”

With Hamilton having been forced out of this weekend’s second Bahrain race because of a positive coronavirus test, Mercedes has been pondering its options about who best to step in.

It is understood that the choice from the off was whether to hand the opportunity to reserve driver Stoffel Vandoorne, who is flying to Bahrain tonight following this week’s Formula E test at Valencia, or arrange a deal to take Russell from Williams.

Vandoorne and Russell are the only two available drivers who have had seat fittings with the team and have previous experience of working with the outfit, factors that are believed to rule out other options like Nico Hulkenberg.

Russell is part of the Mercedes young driver programme and his three-year deal at Williams was always being viewed as a way of preparing him for a future with the German car manufacturer’s works team.

Any move to take Russell would not be automatic, however, with the young Briton under firm contract at his current Grove-based outfit.

However, with Mercedes having a good relationship with the Williams team, it is possible that a separate deal could be arranged to loan him out. Sources suggest that discussions about a potential deal are ongoing.

Beyond any financial incentive of loaning Russell, an added attraction for Williams would also be that the youngster, who is committed to the team for 2021, would return to it after his loan spell as a higher profile driver with some solid experience from a front-running car and potentially strong results underneath him.

Russell also brings with him current race experience and a good understanding of this year’s Pirelli tyres.

For while Vandoorne has extensively tested in the Mercedes simulator, and will likely having done preparation work for this weekend’s race on the outer loop, he has not raced in F1 since the end of the 2018 F1 season.

Russell is believed to be Mercedes’ preferred option because of the benefits it will bring him in terms of his long term development.

But it is understood no final decision has been taken as talks remain ongoing between Mercedes and Williams about the scope of any arrangement.

Mercedes is believed to want a decision made by Wednesday morning, however, so it can prepare properly for the weekend ahead.

Should a deal be struck for Russell to move to Mercedes for either one or two grands prix, then Williams is likely to promote its reserve driver Jack Aitken for his F1 debut.

Aitken is due to race in the F2 season finale this weekend, and took part in a Friday free practice session for Williams at this year’s Styrian Grand Prix.
