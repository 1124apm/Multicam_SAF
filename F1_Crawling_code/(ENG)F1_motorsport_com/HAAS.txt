DATE: 2020

Grosjean has been forced to miss the final two races of the 2020 season due to injuries sustained to his hands in his fiery accident at the Bahrain Grand Prix two weeks ago.

It marked a premature end to Grosjean’s time with Haas, having previously confirmed his exit at the end of the current season, and is likely to have been his final F1 appearance.

Grosjean previously said that if he could not race in Abu Dhabi,  to ensure the accident is not his final memory of F1.

But Grosjean will not be able to complete this test with the Haas team he spent five seasons racing for as it does not have any old machinery available and running for him to test.

“Unfortunately we don’t have any old cars, because we don’t have power units,” team principal Steiner told Motorsport.com.

“We have got plenty of old cars, but they have no engine in it, so we cannot do that unfortunately.

“Maybe in the future we’ve got something, I don’t know. But at the moment, I couldn’t make that promise."

in one of its older cars if no other team is able to accommodate it.

Steiner hoped that it would be possible to arrange a run for Grosjean for Ferrari - who supplies Haas with engines - at an event in the future, rather than draw in a power unit just for a test in a Haas car.

“It’s more likely to able to talk to Ferrari to have him drive one of their older cars when they do an event or something,” Steiner said.

“That is for sure possible to do. I think that is the easier solution than us preparing a car, because they have got the department which is doing that stuff for customers. We don’t have these resources at the moment.

“But if he wants to do it, I’ll let him heal up completely, and then we’ll see what he wants to do and what he’s able to do.

“Then we’ll decide if he can make a good day of fun out of it, the last day in an F1 car for him.”

Grosjean returned home to Switzerland at the start of the week, where he will continue treatment for burns to his hands that were sustained in the accident.

Once recovered, he would be permitted to test F1 machinery that is at least two years old, meaning he could drive a 2019-spec car from early next year.

Grosjean revealed on Friday that he intended to race in Abu Dhabi with a special helmet design created by his three young children.

“This is the most beautiful helmet I could ever imagine,” Grosjean wrote on Instagram. “It was created by Sacha, Simon and Camille for my last F1 race in Abu Dhabi.

“I will try to give it a ride in the future as it's far too beautiful to stay at home unused!”

Outgoing Haas F1 driver  for next season, racing in the top DPi category.

It will mark a first foray into sportscar racing for Magnussen, and brings the curtain down on an F1 career that started back in 2014 with McLaren.

Asked by Motorsport.com if he was treating this weekend’s season finale at the Yas Marina Circuit as his final race, Magnussen said he was ready to say goodbye to F1.

"I’m pretty at peace with it,” Magnussen said. “I know in motorsport you should never say never. In Formula 1, lots of things can happen, and you should never say never.

“But I’m ready to call this my last race. I’m going to go out and enjoy it, drive the car, this amazing car that is so satisfying to drive, and just think back on this amazing opportunity that i’ve been given.

“Growing up as a kid and dreaming about Formula 1, and wanting to get to Formula 1, and getting there and making a career out of it, it’s something that I feel really lucky and privileged to be able to have done.”

Magnussen made his F1 debut with McLaren in 2014, finishing second at his very first race, but was dropped at the end of his rookie season to make way for Fernando Alonso at the team.

Magnussen went into the 2014 season finale with his future uncertain as McLaren weighed up whether to drop him or Jenson Button.

But he felt emotions were vastly different heading into this weekend’s final race, allowing him to enjoy it more.

“It’s not like I’m really feeling like sad or anything, like last time, in 2014, when I was very nervous about everything,” Magnussen said.

“I remember Abu Dhabi in ’14 being a terrible race. There was so much uncertainty and they had told me that they would take the option, and then it dragged out and they didn’t take the option, and eventually dropped me.

“I remember being so sad about everything and depressed about it. But now, I’ve had a few years in Formula 1, and I’m really looking forward to what is going to happen next.

“It’s super exciting, and something that I’m truly looking forward to.”

Magnussen felt the saddest part of the race weekend would come when he says goodbye to his race mechanics and team for the final time on Sunday.

“Certainly when I park the car for the race, I’m going to think about the fact that jumping out of the car, could be the last time I jump out of a Formula 1 car,” Magnussen said.

“But I think the main thing that’s going to be emotional is saying goodbye to all the guys in Haas F1 Team. It’s a bunch of people that I’ve really grown very close to, and some people that have been super supportive of me over those four years, some guys that I’ve become friends with.

“I’m certainly going to miss working with every other weekend. I think that’s going to be the main emotional thing.”

Grosjean was left with burns to his hands after a terrifying crash on the opening lap of last Sunday’s Bahrain Grand Prix, escaping from a large fire that followed a collision with the barrier at Turn 3 recording more than 50G.

Grosjean was ruled out of this weekend’s Sakhir Grand Prix on Monday, but remained hopeful that he could race in Abu Dhabi and make his final appearance for Haas ahead of his departure.

But in a statement issued shortly before Sunday’s second Bahrain race, Haas announced that Grosjean would not be racing in Abu Dhabi, but will instead return home to Switzerland to continue treatment for his injuries.

Reserve driver Pietro Fittipaldi will once again stand in for Grosjean at the Yas Marina Circuit.

“It is with great sadness that I will not be able to do my final race in Abu Dhabi and be with the team there,” said Grosjean.

“We’ve tried as much as we could with the doctor to recover and to repair my hand, but the risk of racing is too big for my recovery and my health.

“So, the decision was made that I’m not going to race. It’s one of the hardest decisions of my life, but it’s obviously one of the wisest.

“I will miss the team, but I will be supporting them as ever.”

Grosjean has already said that he would like to complete a private F1 test at the earliest opportunity to ensure his time in the series does not end with his accident.

Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff confirmed on Saturday that he would be willing to accommodate such a test should no other team be working with Grosjean.

“I’m naturally very sorry that Romain will miss what was going to be his final race with Haas,” said Haas team boss Gunther Steiner.

“But we are all in agreement that he has to take the best course of action regarding his treatment and recovery from last Sunday’s incident.

“Romain has shown exceptional bravery and amazing spirit over the last few days. We know how badly he wanted to be able to return to the cockpit of the VF-20 in Abu Dhabi. And we all would have loved him to have been there too.”

Grosjean joined Haas for its debut F1 season in 2016, with this weekend’s Sakhir Grand Prix set to be the team’s first race where the Frenchman is not in one of his cars.

The team announced in October that Grosjean would be leaving after five years, making way for an all-rookie line-up of Nikita Mazepin and Mick Schumacher in 2021.

“Romain believed in our Formula 1 project at the very start, he committed to drive for us before we’d even built a car,” Steiner said.

“There is no doubting the determination and sheer effort he has put into helping us to achieve what we have as a young team in Formula 1.

“We will forever be grateful for that belief and commitment. It is those qualities, his drive and ambition, that I’m sure will aid him on his recovery.

“On behalf of Gene Haas and myself, together with the whole Haas F1 Team operation, we wish Romain well and a return to full health.”

The Brazilian, who takes over Romain Grosjean’s PU season allocation, received a new energy store and a new control electronics for FP3 on Saturday.

Fittipaldi enjoyed a solid first day with Haas on Friday, taking 19th place in FP1 after damaging his tyres when he locked up, and then 18th in FP2.

“It’s been a year since I’ve driven an F1 car, eight months since I’ve driven anything on track,” he said.

“I took the day step-by-step, I just kept my focus and kept calm. I was really happy with the day. The team has helped me with everything, the engineers did a great job talking me through things, and the mechanics have done a great job as well.

“The only set-back was in FP1, we had a lock-up that damaged my tyres, I couldn’t do any further running. I kept my cool and we just went into FP2 and got through our run plan.”

Team boss Guenther Steiner said on Friday that Fittipaldi had settled in well, and noted that it was too early to discuss whether he will retain the reserve role in 2021.

“He really prepared well for it over the last week since we told him he is going to race instead of Romain,” said Steiner.

“He prepared himself and we just have to let the weekend come to us and try to make progress with him.

“I don’t know really yet what he is going to do next year, whether he is going back to race in some other series, We haven’t really talked about that one. But Pietro became a friend to the team in the two years he is with us.”

DATE: 2020

The Frenchman crashed out of the Bahrain Grand Prix on the opening lap last weekend, with his car plunging through the barriers and splitting in to two before bursting into flames.

Grosjean said that he initially did not realise that the car was on fire when he first tried to get out, but then faced difficulties finding a way out of the cockpit as he was briefly trapped.

“For me it wasn't quite 28 seconds, it felt more like 1m30s if I'd put a time on it,” said the Haas driver, speaking to media on Friday afternoon in Bahrain.

“When the car came to a stop, I opened my eyes, and undid my seatbelt straight away. The thing I didn't remember the next days what what did I do with the steering wheel because I don't have the memory of taking the steering wheel off and putting it out?

“The team said no, the steering had gone in between your legs, the column and everything broke and went down. I didn't have to bother with the steering wheel then, so I tried to jump out. But I felt like something was touching my head, so I sit back down in the car and my first thought was, I'm going to wait. I'm upside down against the wall, so I'm going to wait that come someone comes and helps me.”

Grosjean said at this moment he thought the biggest danger had passed, but it was then that he realised there was a fire.

“I wasn't in distress and obviously I didn’t know there was this fire. Then I look right and left and watching on the left, I see fire. So I say, okay, I don't really have the time to wait here.

“So the next thing is that I tried to go up a bit more on the right, and it doesn't work. I go again on the left, it doesn't work. I sit back down and then I thought about Niki Lauda, his accident, and thought, yeah, it couldn't end like this. It couldn't be my last race. It couldn't finish like this. No way. So I try again. And I'm stuck.”

Grosjean then says this moment was the most difficult for him as he briefly felt his body relaxing and started wondering if he was not going to get out and how much pain he was going to go through.

“I go back down and then there's the less pleasant moment where my body started to relax. I'm at peace with myself and [I think] I'm going to die. I asked my question: is it going to burn my shoe, or my foot or my hand? Is it going to be painful? Where is it going to start?

“To me that looks like two, three or four seconds. I guess it will be milliseconds at a time. And then, I think about my kids, and they cannot lose their dad today. So I don't know why I did it, but I decided to turn my helmet on the left hand side and to go up and then try to twist my shoulder. That sort of worked.

“But then I realised my foot is stuck in the car. So I sit back down. I pull as hard as I can on my left leg. The shoe stayed where my foot was, but my foot came out of the shoe.

“And then I do it again and then the shoulder is going through [the gap] and, at the time the shoulder was through, I know I'm going to jump out. I've got both hands on the fire that time.

“My gloves are red normally, and I see, especially the left one, changing colour, starting melting and going full black. I feel the pain that my hands are in the fire, but also I feel the relief that I am out of the car.

“Then I jump out, I go on the barrier and then I feel Ian [Roberts, F1 doctor] pulling on my overalls. So, I know I'm not on my own anymore and there is someone with me.”

Once out of the car and being led away, Grosjean said he feared he was a human fireball, but says he instantly had the presence of mind to remove his gloves in case they continued burning his hands.

“When I land and then they touch on my back, I'm like, 'Oh shit, I'm like a running fireball. I had that image that we've seen a video from the FIA when they did a test, they put someone on fire and he runs around just to show the overalls were strong. I've got an image that I've got fire following me.

“Then I shake my hand because they're very hot in pain. I removed my gloves straight away because I've got also that image that the skin is in bubbles and melting, and it's going to stick to the gloves. So straight away I want to remove both of my gloves so that the skin doesn't go with it.

“Then Ian comes to see me and speaks to me and says 'Sit down!' I gave him shit and said, ‘talk to me normally please’. I guess he understood that I was okay at a time, that I was normal. And then we sit and we're too close to the fire and I hear the extinguisher guys from the fire saying 'the battery is on fire, bring some other extinguisher bring some other extinguisher'.

“Then we go into the medical car. Sit down. They put some cold compress on my hand. I told them my hands are burned, my foot is broken. But then the pain really starts going very high, especially on the left foot. The hands were okay at a time, the left foot starts being very painful.”

With the ambulance on his way, Grosjean was then told that he would be stretchered away, but he defiantly told Roberts that he wanted to walk from the medical car so he could show the world he was not seriously injured.

“Ian explains to me the ambulance is coming and they're going to come with the bed and I’m going to be okay. We keep talking at the time. And I say ‘no, no, no we are walking to the ambulance’. They say. 'no, no, no, the bed is coming’. I say 'no no no', and I walk out of the car and I say we are walking. They then say okay we're going to help you.

“I guess on the medical side it wasn't the perfect decision but they understood that for me it was key at the point that there was some footage of me walking towards the ambulance, even though I'd walked out of the fire.

“I needed to send another strong message that I was okay and I was going to walk towards the ambulance.

“After that every time I met anyone, I would say two burned hands, one broken foot. That's all I could say to everyone that I was meeting. I was scared obviously of my condition and I wanted everyone that was coming in and treating me to know what the symptoms were.

“But that is the full story of the 28 seconds. As you can imagine, it looked longer than 28 seconds with all the thoughts I had, so they must have been milliseconds.”

However, the modest pair would be the first to admit that they are just the tip of the iceberg on any given grand prix weekend, backed up by the local medics and marshals stationed around the track.

Indeed a Bahraini fireman, a guy whose day job is with the country’s civil defence force, was at the heart of the rapid response that helped to ensure that Grosjean was able to walk away with minor injuries.

The truth is that Roberts and Van der Merwe have been heroes for years, like their predecessors in their roles, performing a vital but largely unheralded task. They are always there, stationed in their Mercedes AMG estate at the end of the pitlane, with a local doctor occupying one of the rear seats.

By definition a good grand prix weekend is one when we don’t notice them, because that means there have been no serious incidents that required their attention.

A former British F3 champion and BAR test driver, Van der Merwe was still an active racing driver when he landed the medical car driving job back in 2009.

Roberts, well known in the sport as the chief medical officer at Silverstone, joined him at the start of 2013. He replaced Gary Hartstein, who had taken over from Sid Watkins – the man responsible for making the medical car such a vital part of any race weekend.

Van der Merwe and Roberts are most visible on the first lap, when they follow the pack around. Had Grosjean’s accident occurred at any other time in the Bahrain event, it would have taken them much longer to get there. Indeed, had it happened later around the first lap, vital time would have been lost.

In fact, Van der Merwe stopped at the crash site just beyond Turn 3 only nine seconds after the initial impact. Roberts was able to jump out of the passenger side and head straight to the fire, just as a marshal – who had crossed the track – arrived with an extinguisher. Initially it was hard to comprehend the scene they found, given the rarity of fire in the modern era.

“We saw the fireball early on, of course,” says Roberts. “But then arriving on scene, the car, well half a car, the rear end, was pointing in the wrong direction. And it was, ‘Where on earth is the rest?’

“We just looked to the right. And it was pretty obvious where it was, with a big gap in the armco. And we could see through, with Romain trying to try to get himself out.”

Spotting Grosjean amid the flames was crucial, and Roberts helped the marshal direct the extinguisher straight at the cockpit. That blast allowed Roberts himself to get closer, and in pushing the flames back it may also have given the disorientated driver a crucial chance to see what he was doing as he struggled to escape.

“Not to put too fine a point on it, but it looked like an oven,” says Roberts. “So it was red with flame. And you could see him trying to get himself out, and he was gradually getting himself further and further out.

“But it was how do we get to him? There was a fire marshal pretty rapidly on scene. And that push of the extinguisher, the powder just pushed the flames back enough.

“Once Romain was high enough then we could get him over the barrier and away. But it's a very small window, I have to say because as soon as the extinguisher powder went forward, the flames were coming back pretty soon afterwards.

“That bit was stinging. It's definitely helped my tan! Something melted on me, but I was pretty well protected otherwise. The flame was pretty intense.”

It’s worth pointing out that while he wears racing overalls, Roberts has an open helmet – so he was putting himself at considerable personal risk. He couldn’t just dive in.

“If there's somebody in trouble, you go and help,” he says. “You have to assess the risk. I mean, it would have been daft to try and go in there with the flames coming towards you, so that extinguisher helped, for sure.

“To incapacitate myself, it would have been crazy to do that. It's a balance of risk. I go in when I can, if the flames are coming at me, there's nothing I can do. As much as it's upsetting, you can only do so much.”

He downplays his actions, but to get so close to the flames, especially with an open helmet, was an act of considerable bravery.

“That's what we're here to do,” says Van der Merwe. “And that's what Ian's been doing all of his life pretty much, rescuing people when they're in a bit of trouble.

“Funnily enough, priority number one is not actually the driver, it's Ian, because when Ian is down, then nothing's going to happen anymore.

“So you kind of have to manage your risk appropriately. Ian runs in there and gets incapacitated, I'm not going to be able to do much.

“There's so many things to balance it to just, to judge within one or two seconds, whether we're waiting for fire support, for some extinguisher support, or whether you're trying to go in. There's a lot there's a lot to decide.”

After Grosjean jumped over the barrier, Roberts was able to lead him to the medical car, while Van der Merwe gave both men a quick squirt of extinguisher powder. Grosjean may have been mobile, but the priority was to check for injuries that might not have been obvious.

“He said that he was in pain from his foot, and from his hands, because as you know, he has some burns on his hands, which are extremely painful,” says Roberts.

“But it was just a matter of getting him sat down briefly, just to check the life threatening things were covered. And then getting him away from the flame. So then, it was into the ambulance and off to the medical centre.

“Of course, I'd have to say that it's not just the two of us, we have a national doctor with us in the car, there's a whole medical team here, a whole set of marshals, fire marshals, rescue people.

“And they all did their bit. If they weren't there, it's not just a two-man show, we work with a team, we work together as a team. So it's important to recognise that.”

Given the scale of the accident and the fact that debris had obviously passed over the barrier, Roberts also had to ensure that no one else was involved.

“There's always a quick check of the scene,” he says. “And there's always the danger that there might be somebody else across a barrier that you've not seen, it could be a marshal who's been hit by debris, and suddenly somebody says, ‘Where are they?’ And they find them behind a barrier.

“So it's important just to have a quick scan, to make sure. There have been scenarios in the past where for multiple incidents where you really do need to account for everyone.

“We work very, very, very closely with race control, as you can imagine, and with the local teams too. I definitely want to emphasise it's a big team effort.”

It’s worth recalling that Roberts has vast experience in trauma, having worked for many years in HEMS (helicopter emergency medical service).

He’s been at the scenes of hundreds of serious incidents both in his day job and in motor racing, including sadly the Jules Bianchi crash at Suzuka in 2014.

However, he and Van der Merwe are not a fire service, as they are usually not expected to arrive at such a dramatic incident, because in normal circumstances marshals would beat them to it. And yet those hours of training and preparation kicked in.

“At the beginning of every day we run through a checklist for the car, for our equipment,” says Roberts. “But we also run through a checklist of scenarios.

“So we always talk about cars under barriers, cars on the roof, like Lance [Stroll], flipping onto the roof. We've already talked about that scenario, and what we do in mobilising marshals.

“The same for fire. Go for the extinguisher, and we go in and do what we can, as the fire is being extinguished. No, we're not firemen. We're not fire trained. But we know how to use them.”

“It's important to note that we're not there for the easy ones,” says Van der Merwe. “We're there for the ones that are genuinely novel.

“Nine out of 10 accidents are easily survivable. Everything works as it should, the barriers and all of these things kind of work perfectly.

“Every now and then, let's say once every five years or so, we see something that exceeds the design parameters of what we thought of. And that's what we hit.

“That's why we have 550 horsepower, so that we're there three seconds quicker. And that's why we take all the shortcuts we can.

“And so we're looking for tiny, tiny things, so that if Ian was there five seconds slower, or if he took five seconds to decide, it could be very different.”

Fortunately on this occasion everything worked as planned, with a little help from pure good fortune.

“The outcome was incredibly positive,” says Van der Merwe. “In terms of incidents that we've seen together, this was very much at the top of the list in terms of magnitude of being impressive.”

DATE: 2020

Schumacher was announced as a future driver for the team earlier today, and he has already been confirmed for a Friday FP1 session in Abu Dhabi, where he will be free of any F2 commitments.

Reserve drive  for this weekend’s Sakhir GP, and at the moment the plan is for Frenchman to return for the Abu Dhabi finale.

Grosjean was discharged from hospital on Wednesday morning, and he is continuing his recovery from burns to his hands in a Bahrain hotel.

While a decision on Grosjean's participation won't be made until next week, Schumacher says that he would be happy to make an early graduation if the question arises.

“I think it's great if you are considered to be ready to do that,” said the German. “I feel like I am. Obviously, you have three FPs, in which you have time to learn.

“Obviously, it would be a challenge, but definitely, I think I would be able get to know the car more to be even better prepared for next year.”

Team boss Guenther Steiner insisted that so far there has been no discussion about the possibility of Schumacher racing.

“We haven't spoken,” he insisted. “As I said before, at the moment the status is I want to see where Romain is on Monday.

“That’s what I agreed with him. We have got enough drivers on standby, who can drive, so I'm not worried about that, and we just take the decision when we know hundred percent that Romain can not drive.

“I think he can finish his time with Haas in a race, that's what I would like, and not just watching it. That is our aim, that is what we spoke with him about.

“I said, 'I fully support that you want to go out on a high,' and he said, ‘If I can do it, that is what I want to do.’

"We're not deciding anything before we know that he can definitely not drive.”

Although Schumacher will get his first run in the Haas on Friday in Abu Dhabi Steiner downplayed the significance of the FP1 outing, and suggested that winter testing with the 2021 car would be more important.

“There are only three days of testing in front of next season,” he said when asked by Motorsport.com.

“I think that is a lot more important than the FP1. I think everybody knows my opinion about that, that is a nice thing to do, but it’s not something where you learn a lot. I think the biggest thing you learn is dealing with pressure on a race event, the car technically, there is not a lot you can learn.

“For sure the [young driver] test session after Abu Dhabi is good, a day in the car is good for anybody.

“But the most important thing is that we have a flawless test before next season, that we don’t have any issues in the three days, because three days is not a lot of testing, divided by two.”

Asked why Schumacher and not his future teammate Nikita Mazepin had been given the Abu Dhabi FP1 run Steiner said: “It just developed like this, sometimes things just develop like this. There is no real analysis or study of it done, I don’t know who was there first.”

Grosjean sustained burns to the back of his hands in a dramatic accident on the opening lap of the race at the Bahrain International Circuit that saw him hit the barrier at 137 mph, recording a force of more than 50g.

Grosjean was taken to the Bahrain Defence Force Hospital after escaping the fire and being taken to the medical centre, and was suspected to have broken a rib in the crash.

But subsequent X-rays showed that Grosjean had sustained no fractures, meaning he only required treatment to the burns on his hands.

Grosjean was meant to be discharged from hospital on Tuesday, but it was decided to keep him in for an additional night.

Haas announced on Wednesday morning that Grosjean had left hospital, but would remain in Bahrain to undergo further private treatment for the burns.

“Haas F1 Team driver Romain Grosjean was discharged from the care of the Bahrain Defence Force (BDF) Hospital at 10:30am local time on Wednesday,” a statement reads.

“Grosjean spent three nights in hospital following Sunday’s incident at the Bahrain Grand Prix.

“Grosjean will continue private treatment for the burns suffered on the back of his hands and will remain in Bahrain for the time being.

“On behalf of Romain Grosjean and the entire Haas F1 Team, we extend our thanks to all who have tended to him at the BDF Hospital.”

as a result of his injuries, with his place at Haas being taken by reserve driver Pietro Fittipaldi.

But the Frenchman remains hopeful of returning for the season finale in Abu Dhabi on 13 December, with Haas set to make a decision depending on his condition early next week.

“I spoke to him yesterday about it, he really wants to be in Abi Dhabi,” said Haas F1 team principal Gunther Steiner.

“But I said, 'try to get better, we’ll speak on Sunday or Monday let's say, how you feel, if it is doable.'

"Pietro is here, Romain is here, we just have to see how he feels, so I'm not in a hurry to decide what to do, or what is needed. It depends on his health.”

Haas F1 driver Grosjean sustained burns to the backs of his hands in a terrifying crash on the opening lap of the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday, leaving him in need of treatment in hospital.

Although Grosjean is set to be released from hospital on Tuesday, Haas has announced that he is unable to race in the Sakhir Grand Prix this weekend.

As a result, Haas reserve driver Fittipaldi will get the call up to make his F1 debut, replacing Grosjean.

"After it was decided that the best thing for Romain was to skip at least one race, the choice to put Pietro in the car was pretty easy," said Haas F1 team principal Gunther Steiner.

"Pietro will drive the VF-20 and he's familiar with us having been around the team for the past two seasons as a test and reserve driver.

"It's the right thing to do and obviously a good opportunity for him. He's been patient and was always prepared for this opportunity, and now it has come.

"That's why we want him in the car and I'm sure he'll do a good job. It's very demeaning being called in at the last minute, but as I said, I think it's the right thing to do for Haas."

Fittipaldi is the grandson of two-time F1 world champion Emerson Fittipaldi, and won the 2017 World Series Formula V8 3.5 title before appearing in IndyCar and once in Super Formula alongside his Haas reserve commitments.

The Brazilian acknowledged it was "not ideal" circumstances under which to make his debut, but thanked the team for its faith to put him in the car.

"I've been with the team a lot this season, both trackside and working on simulator sessions, so I'm familiar with the team's operating procedures on a grand prix weekend," he said.

"It's going to be exciting to make my first career start in Formula 1. I'll be giving it my all and I look forward to starting in free practice on Friday in Bahrain."
