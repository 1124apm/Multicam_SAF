McLaren driver Sainz was placed under investigation by the race stewards in the F1 season finale for a possible slow entry to the pit lane, holding up Racing Point’s Lance Stroll.

Despite an uneventful race and plenty of time to complete the investigation, the stewards confirmed they would only look at the matter after the race.

It meant McLaren had to wait for a decision before it could officially celebrate third place in the constructors’ championship, with Sainz provisionally finishing sixth behind teammate Lando Norris.

after estimating Sainz only slowed enough to lose 0.6 seconds in the pit lane. They also accepted the Spaniard’s explanation that he slowed down in response to the busy pit lane under the Virtual Safety Car.

Masi explained after the race that the stewards were eager to review all of available information in the incident, reasoning the decision to postpone the investigation.

"There was some data that was necessary that we wanted to get hold of, so that takes obviously a little bit longer to get,” Masi said.

“As a result, it was easier to look at it completely after the race, once we had all of that available information, and was also helpful getting the perspectives of the respective drivers.”

Asked by Motorsport.com how “unnecessarily slow” was determined by the stewards, Masi said it was down to their judgement.

“Driving unnecessarily slowly in the pit lane comes about as a result of a discussion with all of the teams sporting directors and the stewards earlier this year,” Masi said.

“So as long as we had to look at it all, it’s a judgement. It’s why we have stewards.”

Stroll was told to “blend” into the fast lane of the pit lane after his pit stop as Sainz came past, and appeared to narrowly avoid an Alfa Romeo mechanic who was stood in the next pit box.

Masi confirmed the stewards did note and look into the incident, but determined no investigation necessary.

“It was looked at, but it wouldn’t be classified as an unsafe release,” Masi said.

The Woking-based outfit pipped rival Racing Point for the best-of-the-rest slot behind the top two teams in the F1 season finale in Abu Dhabi last weekend.

The result, coming off the back of , comes amid suggestions that McLaren could make a big step forward as it switches to Mercedes engines next season.

But Seidl is cautious about expecting too much from McLaren next year, as he says the team must accept the two outfits ahead of it are still a step clear.

“I think we need to stay realistic,” he said. “Despite the good result we have this weekend and, despite the great outcome for us in the championship side, with P3, I think we know exactly where we are. There's still a huge gap to the cars in front, especially the Mercedes car.”

Seidl does take huge encouragement from the progress that McLaren was able to make with its MCL35 this year, as well as the way in which it executed race weekends and dealt with an aggressive update strategy.

However, with McLaren openly admitting that it needs to improve its wind tunnel, simulation facilities and simulator, Seidl thinks it will take a few years before it can hope to get on terms with teams like Mercedes.

“I think the most important thing is to first of all see that the team this year, under the leadership of James Key, has produced a very competitive car,” he explained. “It is a step forward compared to last year.

“It was great to see also that despite all these challenges in the pandemic, that the team kept pushing flat out back home in engineering, and in production, to continuously bring updates to the track, which in the end, kept improving the performance of the car.

“And of course it's a great finish to the season, knowing that at this track, at this specific event, we had the third fastest car.

“But still, we know what the gap to Mercedes is. It is not something we will close from one year to the next year.

“We still know that we have a lot of deficits within the team in terms of organisation, in terms of infrastructure, which we need to close first.

“But again, we have a clear plan of how we want to reduce these deficits. It will take time. But I'm confident that if we do the right things on the team side, we can close these gaps in some years.”

DATE: 2020

Norris qualified fourth for McLaren at the Yas Marina circuit on Saturday, finishing just 0.251 seconds off Max Verstappen's pole position time.

Norris was aided by a fresh Renault power unit in his McLaren car that was fitted for the last race in Sakhir, with most of the grid using engines that are nearing the end of their lives.

Asked by Motorsport.com about his qualifying display and how much of a boost the fresher power unit offered, Norris hailed his qualifying lap as being the best of the season.

"Obviously I've got the new PU in, and it's helping me out a lot more than what it was bringing me down over the last three or four weeks," Norris said.

"Maybe I have half a tenth advantage or something over the whole lap. I'm not two-and-a-half, three-tenths down like the last few weekends, a bit more competitive, which is nice.

"I didn't think that was the help at the end, I think my Q3 lap was just very strong, and just a very nice, tidy lap. It wasn't like it was perfect altogether, but it was definitely my best of the year, I think in terms of getting the tyres in a good window and maximising what we have as a package this weekend.

"It took me by surprise, and probably all of us by surprise, how close we were to pole in the end of the day. I think that was the surprising thing.

"But of course, P4 and the lap I did, I was very happy with. It was a nice way to end qualifying this season."

Team principal Andreas Seidl was eager to review all of the data from qualifying before making a firm judgement of the gap, but remained realistic of the job McLaren must do to catch the leading teams.

"Lando was feeling comfortable with the car all weekend, and in the end, he was building up in qualifying and simply did a brilliant lap as he said, probably one of the best laps he did in qualifying since he became an F1 driver," Seidl said.

"Regarding the gap to both the Red Bull and Mercedes, to be honest, I simply need to wait for more analysis, if we understand if they had any specific issues with their qualifying sessions.

"It's nice to be that close to them, but at the same time we also know where we are compared to these guys. But it's great motivation to have a qualifying like this, the last race of the season, and yeah, another confirmation that we are heading in the right direction as a team.

"We also know that we have a long way to go, so you always need to be realistic as well, as where you are, and about the steps you can make in the next years.

"But we have a very talented and motivated team here at the track and back home, and obviously very happy with the progress we could make this year."

Norris qualified a lowly 15th on Saturday at the Bahrain International Circuit after mistiming his final lap in Q2, with the gains made by other drivers shuffling him to the bottom of the order.

It left McLaren weighing up a potential change to Norris’s Renault power unit in order to gain fresh parts ahead of the race and the season finale in Abu Dhabi next weekend.

FIA F1 technical delegate Nikolas Tombazis - who is standing in for Jo Bauer this weekend - confirmed ahead of Sunday’s race in Bahrain that McLaren had taken two new parts on Norris’s power unit.

By fitting a fresh engine and turbocharger, Norris’s car has now exceeded the seasonal limit for both parts, triggering a grid penalty.

As a result, Norris will start today’s race from the back of the grid.

The McLaren driver will join Pietro Fittipaldi of Haas on the final row after the Brazilian also took new power unit elements on Saturday.

Although Fittipaldi is making his F1 debut, he continued with regular Haas driver Romain Grosjean’s allocation, meaning the new energy store and control electronics fitted to his car exceeded the season limit.

Both Norris and Fittipaldi have ‘back of grid’ penalties, but as Norris qualified higher, he is due to start ahead of the Haas racer.

Norris’s penalty hands positions to Kevin Magnussen, Nicholas Latifi, Jack Aitken and Kimi Raikkonen on the grid, gaining one place each.

Norris is in need of a fightback to aid McLaren in its push for third place in the constructors’ championship.

McLaren currently sits 17 points clear of Racing Point in the race for third, but has only one car starting in the top 10 courtesy of Carlos Sainz Jr., who will line up eighth in Bahrain.

Sergio Perez qualified fifth in the leading Racing Point, while teammate Lance Stroll will start 10th.

Norris said after qualifying on Saturday that he felt it could be difficult to overtake around the narrow outer loop layout in Bahrain.

“There should be some some good racing, but it's not as easy as everyone thinks it is to overtake here,” Norris said.

“It may look it, but it's not. I think it's going to be a tough race. So there's still going to be some overtaking, but it's not going to be as easy as what people think.”

The Briton elected to go early for his first effort in Q2, but ended up aborting that lap when he felt that he had already lost too much time in the first sequence of corners.

For his second run, he failed to nail it through the same bends and could not put a representative lap time in – ending up 15th on the grid.

“Q1 run one was alright,” he said. “One mistake on it but it was still a decent lap.

“But Q2 we went out too early, basically, which meant I had to do a very slow out-lap to make sure I didn't catch the traffic at the end or halfway around my lap. That meant the tyres were a little bit on the colder side, and not ideal for Turn 1.

“And when there's only four corners, and the tyres are not in for Turn 1, then you only have three corners to try to make up time and that's not really possible, so I had to abort.

“Then on my second lap, I had no traffic but quite a few people around me in Turn 1 again, which made me lose quite a bit of time. And then just a combination of not driving the perfect lap for the rest of it.

“So, yeah, just not a clean Q2 really. A bit of a mistake from our side as a team in knowing when to go out and start our run, but also my opportunity to put a lap in. I just didn't do the perfect job. So those two things put together made me end up where I was.”

With Norris starting so far down, and with McLaren locked in a tight fight for third place in the constructors’ championship, the team is weighing up fitting a fresh engine and gearbox for the race.

While that would incur a grid penalty that would drop Norris to the back of the grid, it could give him added performance for the final two races of the season. A final decision will be made overnight.

Norris’ teammate Carlos Sainz ended up eighth on the grid, despite picking up some damage in qualifying that hindered his performance.

“There is a bit of a war on this circuit,” said Sainz. “Every time you come back to the pits, you have something broken or something hanging off. But that's the way it is, for how slow we've been all weekend.

"It was the most we could achieve today. It's a good day for us because after FP3 we were looking at 12th and 13th, and we're not so bad. Maybe tomorrow we'll have to look more in the mirror than forward for once, but it's what we have and we'll try to fight for it."

DATE: 2020

In the wake of Sergio Perez's late race retirement that left his flaming car at the side of the circuit, a fire marshal ran across the track right in front of Norris' car.

Norris came on the team radio and exclaimed his surprise at what happened.

"There's a guy f***ing running across the track.. that's the bravest guy I've ever seen," said the young Briton.

With F1 well aware of the dangers of such situations, with Tom Pryce having been killed after hitting a marshal and his fire extinguisher at the 1977 South African Grand Prix, Seidl says the matter needs to be treated seriously.

However, he has faith that the FIA and F1 race director Michael Masi will do everything that is necessary to address the situation.

"It's obviously concerning if you hear a comment like this from Lando over the radio," said Seidl. "And it's clearly something that should absolutely not happen. But I think as well, it's something that's important to analyse behind closed doors together with the FIA.

"I'm sure Michael is doing that, together with the input he wants from us. I'm sure the right conclusions will be made and we will keep working together on improving safety for our drivers and for all the marshals on the tracks worldwide."

Speaking about the incident afterwards, Norris said that the marshal had been hard to spot against the dark background.

"It was the last thing I was expecting," explained Norris. "The guy didn't look left and right both ways before he crossed the road.

"It was a double yellow. And I was going slow enough, so there was no point in risking anything at all.

"But he wasn't the most visible guy, because at that point, you know, I'm looking to the sky and he's wearing black or dark blue. He wasn't that easy to see, all I kind of saw was a bouncing extinguisher. It was just a bit of a crazy moment."

DATE: 2020

The Spaniard had looked on course for a strong showing at Sakhir but was put out of qualifying right at the start of Q2 when his rear tyres locked up and pitched him into a spin at the first corner.

McLaren confirmed the spin was caused by a brake failure.

As well as that failure leaving him down in 15th on the grid, the lock up has effectively robbed him of a set of tyres – which will limit his strategy opportunities in the race.

"It leaves us with very few options if we have lost it [the set of tyres] with that lock up,” Sainz told Movistar. “It leaves us with very small options for Sunday. That's why I'm very angry, I'm sorry, but I'm very angry."

As well as being limited on how own tyres, Sainz says that the fact all the Q3 runners will be starting on the medium compound means that there is little chance of gaining in the early phase of the race by doing anything different.

"Yes, you can come back, but it gets very complicated,” he explained. “Especially because the top ten is going to start with the medium, and those of us who start behind them won't have any advantage over them.

“The two sets of medium I had saved... one will be ruined and I'm sure I can't even use it. Which puts me in a bit of a tough spot for the race. We worked hard to save harder tyres for the race and now this happens to us...”

McLaren did not have an immediate answer as to what had gone wrong on Sainz’s car, and whether it was related to the brakes, the transmission or engine.

Team principal Andreas Seidl said: “We still don't know, honestly, we have to analyse it. I think that the rear axle has locked up and there was nothing that Carlos could do.

“It is disappointing because we had a competitive car today. Unfortunately, Lando made a small mistake in Turn 1 on his last attempt and Carlos was in good shape all weekend and it's a shame.

"But that's all there is and now it's time to analyse what happened in Carlos' car, reset, and start again tomorrow. It will be an interesting race, with many challenges, with two stops or more and we must try to come back.”

The recent resurfacing of the circuit has left F1 drivers battling against tricky conditions all weekend, with cars sliding around a lot in both the dry and the wet.

And with the surface having had no chance to rubber in thanks to the rain that affected Saturday’s running, things are expected to be just as difficult in the race.

Norris fears, however, that the lack of grip is so bad that it will be hard for drivers to avoid contact on the opening lap tomorrow after the short blast from the grid.

Asked what he expected from the race, Norris said: “I think just quite a risky difficult Turn 1, and probably quite a high possibility of a crash or something.

“We struggle just as much in the dry almost as we do in the wet, to get the tyres in at a good temperature, especially when you're not on soft tyres.

“Also, having the warm up lap, which is going to be the opposite of a warm up lap, you're going to be cooling the tyres down, and it's kind of defeats the object of it. It is going to cause more chaos than I think everyone's almost expecting going into Turn 1.”

The only saving grace for the start, says Norris, is that there is only a short blast down to the first corner so there will not be much chance for anyone to try and risk a dive-bomb move to gain positions.

“I don't think you'll necessarily see anyone diving, because there's not going to be that high speeds,” he added.

“I think it's very easy to make mistakes and probably lock a front tyre or let the rear snap round because the tyres are cold. So it should be exciting. You just have to try and stay out of the carnage.”

Norris’ teammate Carlos Sainz agreed that things were going to be exceptionally difficult on the first lap, and he urged everyone to be sensible.

“I think we all know how slippery and how tricky it is out there,” said the Spaniard. “We've all experienced the conditions, and I think we all know what we can expect from lap one.

“So I hope that everyone just gives each other a bit more space because the mistakes could happen at any time and at any point, without really being intentional.

“It is just that these cars are extremely difficult to control with cold tyres and there could be things happening really without anybody intending it. So let's see what happens.”

DATE: 2020

The run from the Imola grid to the first braking area is one of the longest of the season, but is made trickier by a track that curves to the left and is relatively narrow.

Both McLaren drivers made spectacular progress in the tricky conditions at the start of last weekend’s Portuguese GP, with both men gaining four places on the first lap. At Imola Norris starts from ninth, a place ahead of Sainz.

“It's going to be the main place, lap one down to Turn One,” said Norris when asked about the Imola start by Motorsport.com.

“It is quite a long straight. It'll be our best opportunity to gain multiple positions if we can, but everyone's thinking that at the same time.

“So we just need to make sure we at least make it through the first few corners, and try and go from there and push forward.

“But at the same time we don't know 100% what the racing is going to be like, how easy it's going to be to overtake.

"I don't think it's going to be maybe as unpredictable and as exciting as what it was in Portugal last week, just because it's a bit more normal this weekend, with how the tyres are working and the tarmac and the wind and everything.

“And lap one it’s the best opportunity, and Turn One is the best opportunity on every other lap as well.”

Norris’s teammate Carlos Sainz cautioned that the run to the first corner could get crowded at the start.

“The only thing that I would say is quite narrow into Turn One and Two,” said the Spaniard. “I don't think there's actually that much space to make a lot of moves, or to go three side-by-side. I think maximum two. It's a chicane, that Turn Two and Three.

“These cars are big, especially now looking at the images on the TV, compared to back in the day in 2006, you can really appreciate how the cars are around this circuit. So that's going to make everything a bit more tricky.

“It's going to be a tricky race, obviously 10th is not ideal, that everyone behind you has a new set of tyres and on the chance to choose a strategy, and everyone in front of you is basically on the same strategy or similar. But in the race anything can happen.”

In last weekend’s Portuguese three drivers received five-second penalties for multiple track limits offences, and Norris believes that could be an issue once more after 68 lap times were deleted on Saturday.

“It probably will be,” he said. “The thing is some of the corners here are really good. So, exit of the last corner, exit of Turn 6, I think it is, are just gravel. So there's no chance to run off, you have an exit kerb, and you have gravel. I went off already a couple times, just dipping a wheel in the gravel, and that's punishing enough.

“But then you have some like Turn 9 probably being the biggest example where you can run off. The thing is it has to change all the time from what motorbikes are allowed, to what we are allowed. And it has to please both parties.

“So ideally, we would have it so it's like the exit of the last corner, where there's just gravel, and if you go off, you go off, and it's kind of game over. But it's the way it is. So there's probably going to be a lot of warnings and penalties.”

With Carlos Sainz having been left with  of the updates at the Nurburgring, the team has had a much smoother time at the Algarve circuit.

And after locking out the fourth row of the grid with Sainz in seventh on the grid and Lando Norris eighth, McLaren is upbeat that its performance this weekend has shown the upgrade is working.

Team boss Andreas Seidl said: “I'm happy that we could make a next step in terms of understanding this new nose box concept that we're using.”

Sainz said he felt much more on top of the car this weekend than he had been last time out in Germany.

“The car has been competitive all weekend,” he said. “Especially from my side, I'm much happier with the feeling of the car this weekend and it looks like we as a team, we've done a very good job to understand what happened last weekend.

“The car I was driving here was definitely giving me a much better feeling and I have had an easier weekend.”

Sainz’s comments were backed up by Norris, who says the step forward has come from simply a better understanding of what’s needed to get the most out of the upgrades.

“I think we have a better understanding from Germany,” he said. “There was nothing bad about what we had in Germany, we just didn't have enough time to understand it completely, because of only having one practice session.

“We've come into this weekend with a better understanding, with a better knowledge of how to maximise the package. And I think that's what we've done so far this weekend.”

The McLaren update has so far revolved around a new nose box concept, which is similar to the design used by Mercedes.

With that element now working, McLaren has been evaluating further changes to its car – with tests of new components having been conducted in Friday practice in Portugal.

Seidl added: “We started the race weekend with the initial package of this new nose box concept which Lando ran at the Nurburgring.

“Then we tested additional parts to see how they performed together with this new aero concept, which was positive.

“But these parts are supposed to be introduced in future races, and in the end we continued with the same configuration on both cars, which is pretty much the one Lando used at the Nurburgring.”

Mercedes had to bring replacement staff from the UK after , while Racing Point driver Lance Stroll missed the race and then .

McLaren boss Andreas Seidl says that the positive tests were a “wake-up call”, and led to the Woking outfit reviewing its procedures and doing even more to separate team members – including drivers Carlos Sainz and Lando Norris – on race weekends.

McLaren was the focus of the season's first COVID scare when a team members tested positive at the Australian GP.

“I think with everything that FIA together with F1 and the teams has put in place I think has shown that it is possible to do it in a safe way,” said Seidl when asked by Motorsport.com if the recent cases had impacted McLaren’s planning.

"I think from the first race onwards, we had very strict procedures and policies in place within our team, following also the guidelines that are in place from the FIA side.

“The most important thing is as a team that you will simply make sure you don't get complacent on all these procedures you have in place, sticking to the bubbles, making sure you always keep the distance and so on. And what we simply did again.

“After what happened at the Nurburgring, that's just another wake-up call for the entire team to make sure we don't get complacent and we stick to our procedures that we have in place.

“We did some additional measures now for here again, in terms of separating the people even more, as far as it is possible, in the offices and in the garages.

“We did another step also with the drivers to separate them even more from the team during the race weekend, simply to make sure we do what is possible to do together with this testing machine which is in place.”

Seidl confirmed that McLaren has staff on standby at home.

“As a team, we would be in a position to replace a certain number of people and functions, but it's also clear there's a limit of what you can do and still stay operational as a race team.

"So far, we have been lucky and didn't have an outbreak yet on our side. Hopefully it stays like that with all the protocols we have in place.”

Regarding the rest of the season and the trip to the Middle East, he added: “If you look ahead, of course, we're obviously monitoring what's ongoing in the world and in Europe. We have a permanent dialogue with FIA and F1.

"But again, I think with the procedures we have in place and with the protocols, I think we feel all safe in order to go ahead with the races coming. That's how we see that the moment.”
