The Canadian took his maiden pole position for the team - then called Racing Point - at the Turkish Grand Prix last season, and enjoyed two podium finishes as he enjoyed a step forward in form from his team.

But while chuffed with the good days, he still thinks more could have been more possible were it not for bad luck and catching COVID-19.

“We had some good results: a few fourth places, a couple of podiums, a pole - that was one of the bigger highlights of the season. So it was a good year," Stroll told Motorsport.com.

“I think at the same time, though, it was a year of missed opportunity with the car we had. We had very competitive car - but there were other factors.”

Stroll points to the fact that the first half of the season was so strong for him, as he temporarily moved himself up to the best-of-the-rest slot in the drivers’ standings behind Lewis Hamilton, Valtteri Bottas and Max Verstappen.

But then following a podium finish at the Italian Grand Prix, his campaign went off the rails for a while as retirements, incidents and an absence meant he did not score for five races.

“In the first half of the season I was sitting fourth in the world championship with a good gap to the rest of the pack,” he explained.

“Then after my puncture in Mugello it was a bumpy ride in terms of points. A part of me is a little bit frustrated that in so many races, we kind of just had a bumpy ride, and it ran a little bit downhill since my previous podium in Monza.

“There was a lot of opportunity in some of those races. In Mugello, we were up for the podium there and we had the puncture. And then I got COVID, missed a race there [Nurburgring]. There's been a few unfortunate other races where we just DNF'd, and didn't score any points.

“So I do see some missed opportunity in the season in total. But, all in all, it was a very fun year as well. It was a good year and it was a fun year - just competing in a car that has been up at the front for most of the season. That's been awesome.”

DATE: 2020

Racing Point is just 10 points ahead of McLaren and 22 clear of Renault with millions of dollars of prize fund money riding on the final classification of the three teams in the constructors' championship.

Racing Point made its task harder when it decided to give Sakhir GP winner Sergio Perez a new power unit for the last weekend of the season, committing to him to starting at the back.

However, the team has taken a gamble with Stroll and kept a high mileage engine in his car for this weekend.

Stroll is out of sync on engine usage after he lost the use of one in his heavy crash during the Emilia Romagna GP, obliging his third example of the season to do a lot of mileage in the remaining races.

He regained some miles when Friday was rained out at the Nurburgring and his car was absent from P3 due to illness.

Stroll qualified eighth in Abu Dhabi, ahead of the two Renaults but behind the McLarens, with Lando Norris starting fourth and Carlos Sainz sixth.

“I mean, we're surviving on engine miles this weekend,” the Canadian told Motorsport.com.

“Checo's got a new engine. Because of the puncture in Mugello, we hit the engine quite hard.

“That one was toast, and because we lost that one we had to get a new one, so this one's gone for quite a long time.

“Because I actually I think missed a session for COVID, I think we've managed to kind of eke it out until the end of the year. I don't want to talk too soon.

“We had a couple of races where we weren't sure if it we were gonna change the engine or not and also we're really trying to drag it out to the end of the season.

“But it's a long race tomorrow, a lot can happen. We're in the fight with McLaren, and they're starting in a good position.”

Stroll admitted that his lap times could be compromised in the race.

“Maybe a tenth a lap or something. But it's racing, a lot can happen. We have a quick car, good strategy, good start, so a lot could happen tomorrow.”

Perez will start 19th as Haas driver Kevin Magnussen also has an engine penalty. Asked if he had nothing to lose from the back – having won last weekend after his first lap incident and pit stop dropped him down the order – the Mexican said that wasn’t the case.

“We have a lot of things to lose tomorrow,” he told Sky F1. “It still requires a very good race from our side, we have to make sure we get into the points, well into them, because the battle in the championship is very, very tight.

“So we have to make sure that we have a strong race tomorrow and make as much progress as we possibly can.”

Perez revealed that knowing he would start from the back, the team concentrated its efforts into giving him a good car for the race.

"We've put everything together for the race, we've focussed on every single bit for the race. We'll see what we are able to do, but a lot of things can happen tomorrow.”

DATE: 2020

The Racing Point driver suffered a suspected MGU-K failure in Bahrain last weekend as he looked on course for a podium finish.

The problem has forced his team to revert to a well-used power unit for this weekend’s Sakhir GP, and the current turbo hybrids produce less power when they are getting towards the end of their life.

Having qualified fifth for the race, one place behind Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, Perez says there is no doubt he is slightly on the back foot by not having a newer engine at his disposal.

“I think we very much maximised our potential, putting absolutely every single corner right,” the Mexican told Sky about his qualifying form.

“Maybe there was a half a tenth, but we didn't have quite the speed of Leclerc, who did a fantastic lap.

“We are suffering a bit with the engine.. We had to go back to our old engine and, at this track, I think we certainly are missing the fresh engines here.”

With only two races to go, and Racing Point locked in a tight fight with McLaren and Renault for third place in the constructors’ championship, the team has tried to steer clear of fitting a fresh engine because that would mean a grid penalty.

Perez says that the focus is on maximising points scoring opportunities, even if it is missing a slight edge on the power front.

Asked how much of a difference the older specification engine made, Perez said: “We're still looking for numbers but it's quite a bit obviously: one tenth around here makes a big difference so we're looking at something like that obviously.

“I think the priority for us will be to make it to the end. We don't want to get a penalty on a new engine.

“We know that we are underperforming on the engine side, but it's more important to try and get the maximum performance. For us the most important is just to make it to the end here and in Abu Dhabi.”

DATE: 2020

And while much of its progress this year has been under the cloud of its copycat tactics in being inspired by last year’s Mercedes design, recent developments have shown it is actually doing more and more its own thing.

The RP20 might still have the advantage of sharing commonality with the W10 when it comes to some of the car’s core aspects but, its decision to use parts that it has designed, plus bring its own updates, has moved the car away from being a complete ‘Pink Mercedes’.

There is no better example of this than the front wing, an aspect of the car’s design you’d expect the team to mimic with extreme accuracy, given it’s the first component exposed to the airflow. On the RP20 it is different in its detail, and the main contrast is in an area that the team spent plenty of last year developing: the footplate.

Racing Point RP19, front wing comparison

The change in regulations for 2019 removed the majority of the aerodynamic furniture responsible for creating ‘outwash’, and this meant that teams had to rethink other aspects of the front wing’s design to compensate.

Racing Point focused its attention on the footplate, as altering its shape, and length in its case, has a bearing on the formation of the vortex that’s shed. This in-turn has an impact on the surrounding flow structures.

Racing Point RP20 front wing end plate comparison

For 2020, rather than simply copy the W10’s arrangement entirely, Racing Point sought to improve upon it.

The team added a long vane atop the footplate to help guide the airflow and adjust the pressure gradient, which also influences the formation, shape and direction of the vortex beneath.

It’s actually been an area of interest for all of the teams given the changes to the regulations. Let’s take a look at how it has faced up to this challenge:

Click on the arrows to scroll through the images below…

The sidepod update package that Racing Point introduced at Mugello has been the biggest development for it so far this season.

This upgrade led to the team stepping out of the shadow of its Mercedes counterpart, as it discarded the more contoured design favoured by Mercedes and replaced it with a more abrupt arrangement. Featuring a more ramped slope (right-side image, with the old version on the left), the sidepod bodywork, which bears more of a resemblance to the designs used during the ‘Coanda’ exhaust era, now clings more closely to the radiator and air-to-air cooler installed beneath and exposes more of the floor than before.

Such a large-scale development takes time to develop, manufacture and understand. This were all factors that were hindered by the adjustments to this season and were made worse when the first set of parts were wrecked at Mugello when Lance Stroll crashed.

Due to the scale of manufacturing of these parts, the team opted to stagger their introduction, with the new parts installed on Stroll’s car for Mugello and another set due to arrive for Perez in Russia. However, when the original set became damaged beyond repair, it set the team back and meant that the first time it could run both cars in the same specification would be the Eifel GP.

With several races experience behind it now, the team has undoubtedly begun to understand the package and continue to unlock performance that can also be gained from adjustments to the power unit too.

DATE: 2020

Stroll took a shock pole position in rainy conditions on Saturday in Turkey, and was able to open up a 10-second lead over the field in the opening stages of the race on full wet tyres.

Although Stroll maintained his lead upon the switch to intermediate tyres, he saw the gap to teammate Sergio Perez narrow at the front, prompting Racing Point to bring Stroll in for a second stop with 22 laps to go.

But the fresh intermediates grained immediately, causing Stroll to fall back through the field as he struggled for pace, losing positions to a number of drivers.

Stroll was passed by Sebastian Vettel, Charles Leclerc, Carlos Sainz, Max Verstappen, Alexander Albon and Lando Norris after his pit stop, leaving him over a minute off race winner Lewis Hamilton at the chequered flag.

“I don't know what happened, I don't understand,” Stroll said after the race.

“We had so much graining on the first set of intermediates. We decided to pit, we were losing seconds a lap.

“I just don't know where that graining came from, it just happened instantly. It grained again, massive graining, and no pace.

“We'll have to look into it, it was pretty terrible today.”

The Canadian admitted he was frustrated to see such a big lead go to waste, having still held onto the lead of the race up until his second pit stop.

Perez did not make a second stop for fresh intermediates, eventually getting to the end of the race on a single set that lasted 48 laps, giving the Mexican second place.

“It's just frustrating that you're in the lead by 10 seconds, and then all of a sudden you finish ninth,” Stroll said.

“I don't understand how that happens. I mean I do, it's graining, but we just need to look into why it hit me so much harder than the other car.

“I’m not so sure why.”

Stroll capitalised on heavy rain and low grip conditions on the new surface at Istanbul Park to score his maiden F1 pole, edging out Red Bull’s Max Verstappen by two-tenths of a second in Q3.

Stroll said after qualifying he was “shocked” by the result following struggles through practice as he became the fifth-youngest pole-sitter in F1 history.

But the Canadian downplayed talk of a potential first F1 victory when speaking after qualifying, believing it would be a huge challenge for Racing Point to maintain its advantage.

“It’s a big ask,” Stroll said. “It depends on what the conditions are doing to do. I haven’t really looked at the conditions yet for Sunday.

“I heard maybe there was a chance of rain at the start of the race, so we’ll see what happens. That could mix things up.

“I’ll deal with that in a couple of hours. I’ll let this sink in. I’m going to enjoy the moment for sure.

“It’s a very special moment for me, [my] first pole position in Formula 1. We’re going to digest that for a couple of hours, and then focus on the race.”

Sunday will mark Stroll’s second appearance on the front row of an F1 grid, having starting second for the 2017 Italian Grand Prix after again impressing in a wet qualifying session.

Racing Point team boss Otmar , but instead the result of a “well-judged” session by Stroll.

Stroll has scored two F1 podiums to date, finishing third in the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix and at this year’s Italian Grand Prix.

He has not scored any points since his appearance on the podium at Monza this year, and admitted earlier this week .

Stroll was joined towards the front of the grid by teammate Sergio Perez, who qualified third, giving the team a chance to rack up a big haul of points in the fight for third place in the constructors’ championship.

Racing Point currently sits fifth in the standings, but is just one point behind third-placed Renault and has the same score as McLaren.

McLaren team boss Andreas Seidl said Racing Point had the chance to “damage our ability to stay in the fight for P3” in Turkey.

“As I've said in previous weeks, we never had this year the third quickest car,” Seidl said.

“I still think there's a chance [to finish third] because we always have two drivers to be able to score good points to stay in this fight for P3.

“But obviously we depend a lot on what's happening tomorrow. We will not give up this fight, as long as we can stay in the points gap.”

With Saturday afternoon's action being hit by multiple red flags, Stroll kept his cool and a change on to intermediate tyre helped him claim the top spot in the final stages of Q3.

The Canadian, who has not scored a point since he finished on the podium at the Italian Grand Prix in September, ended up 0.290 seconds ahead of Max Verstappen, who had looked in control of things earlier on.

Speaking after the session, Stroll said he could not quite believe what had happened, especially because Racing Point had not looked so competitive in free practice.

"I'm shocked," said Stroll. "I didn't expect us to be up here after P3.

"There were a lot of things that we weren't sure of coming into qualifying. We didn't look too competitive in P3, but I'm so happy right now.

"I really put that lap together at the end. I was under a lot of pressure and I only had one lap to do it there at the end, because we started on the wet tyre.

"We boxed for inters and I had one lap where Valtteri [Bottas] spun in front of me, and then I had one lap at the end to do it. But I had the confidence in the car and I just nailed pretty much every corner, and pieced it together nicely.

"It's such a great way to bounce back after a few rough weeks and since Mugello really it's been a rough ride for me so. Yeah. Feels good. Feels really good right now."

Stroll's teammate Sergio Perez had topped the times in the early stages of Q3, but says he lost out on keeping in front as the track improved after being held up by Alfa Romeo's Antonio Giovinazzi.

"It is a great result for the team and something we weren't really expecting," said Perez, who ended up third behind Verstappen. "In the end, we were just unlucky.

"My final lap, when the track was at its best, I had Giovinazzi in front and he simply didn't move out of the way and then I lost my lap.

"Obviously, track position was key today: to be able to maintain your temperature in the tyres. And I think we are in a good position. I definitely prefer P3 [on the grid] than P2. I think tomorrow that will make a difference."

Stroll has failed to score any points since finishing on the podium in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza over two months ago, reaching the chequered flag just once in that time.

By comparison, teammate Sergio Perez has scored 48 points in the same five-race period, helping Racing Point’s bid for third place in the constructors’ championship.

Stroll crashed heavily while running in the points at Mugello before a collision with Charles Leclerc on the opening lap in Russia forced him to retire.

The Canadian then missed the Eifel Grand Prix at the Nurburgring through illness, later testing positive for COVID-19, and retired upon returning in Portugal after clashing with Lando Norris.

Stroll then struggled through the last race at Imola, finishing 13th and overshooting his pit box during the race, prompting Racing Point to say that .

Reflecting on the last two months ahead of this weekend’s Turkish Grand Prix, Stroll conceded it has been a difficult period to get through, but stressed he did not want to dwell on the missed opportunities.

“It hasn’t been fun, I’m not going to lie,” Stroll admitted.

“It’s been frustrating at times. But you know, this sport is a rollercoaster. I’ve had some highs at the beginning of the season.

“Up until Monza, really, it’s been a great season for me, and unfortunately now, I’ve just gone through a rough patch. There’s nothing I can do about it.

“In hindsight, there’s definitely some things that I believe I could have done differently. There’s been some mistakes I have made in some of the races, and that has cost me some points.

“Then there’s been just unfortunate circumstances, like Mugello, like Russia, then of course missing the race in Nurburgring was far from ideal. But that’s in the past now. There’s nothing that I can do about it.

“Instead of dwelling on it, I’m looking forward to the next four races. I know we have a strong package, and there’s plenty of opportunity in the next four races to come back strongly.

“My sights are set on this weekend as it stands, and the remainder of the season.”

DATE: 2020

Perez will leave the Racing Point team at the end of the season after it opted to trigger an exit clause in his contract, paving the way for four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel to join in his place.

Perez had been linked with drives at a number of teams, including Alfa Romeo, Williams and Haas, but appears only to have an option at Red Bull remaining for next year.

Red Bull is considering whether to replace Alexander Albon with a more experienced driver for next year, with Perez appearing to be the leading candidate.

Asked for an update on his future ahead of this weekend’s Turkish Grand Prix, Perez said there was “nothing yet” to report.

“We just have to wait and see, the season is coming soon to an end,” Perez said.

“As I’ve said before, until the teams announce their drivers, everything is an option. Every team that hasn't announced their line-up, it’s an option. So we will see.”

But with time ticking for Perez to land a seat, the Mexican conceded that he could take a break from racing completely next year if he does not get confirmation of his plans soon.

“We are not that far from the season to end, so definitely I have to know my plans,” Perez said.

“I need to know what will happen on my side to be able to plan everything. It’s happening now too late, so we’re already close to December. There is not a lot more to add in that regard.

“Everything is so late now, and it looks like I will know whether I continue in Formula 1 or not quite late in the year.

“So I think a sabbatical, it's an option. But we’ll see what happens in the next couple of weeks.”

Perez was most strongly linked with a move to Williams in recent weeks, only for the team to confirm it would be retaining George Russell and Nicholas Latifi as planned for next year.

Asked by Motorsport.com how far advanced talks were with Williams, Perez replied: “I’ve always kept my talks private. I think it’s the way it always should be.

“More than that, there’s not a lot of point. Nothing happened, so I think there’s not a lot of point of discussing. There were some talks, but nothing more than that.”

Stroll has not scored a single point since he finished on the podium at the Italian Grand Prix in September.

He crashed out in Tuscany and Russia and has enjoyed little luck since illness, , forced him to miss the Eifel GP.

In Portugal he was involved in incidents with Red Bull's Max Verstappen in practice, and with McLaren driver Lando Norris in the race.

At Imola he lost his front wing in first lap contact with Esteban Ocon, and later he blamed cold brakes when he stopped long in his pit stop, sending the team’s front jack man flying. He finished out of the points in 13th.

At both races he was comfortably outqualified by teammate Sergio Perez.

Green says that COVID-19 hit Stroll harder than the team had suspected, and believes that the Canadian’s huge crash in the Tuscan GP at Imola also took its toll.

“Obviously he's not where he was, for sure,” said Green. “From where he was at Monza, to where he is now, there's definitely a lack of confidence, which we're going to have to work on over the next week or so to try and get him back again.

“I think the illness did knock it out of him, that's something that we hadn't really foreseen.

“We had heard about the length of time it can take to recover from the illness, and I think it is taking some time.

“I think he just needs to get his confidence back again, and believe in himself again. And we'll get the Lance back that we had for the first two-thirds of the season."

Expanding on the causes, Green said: “He's obviously taken quite a battering physically and mentally. It was quite a big accident in Mugello. So I think that that probably dented his confidence.

“Physically, we thought it would be difficult at the last race to jump back in. I think that was true. I think now mentally he's just not where he was a few races ago. But I think he needs to get a couple of races under his belt, which is what he's done now.

“I think it is really, really fine margins. And if you're not on top of the car, and understanding where the tyres are, and getting them in their sweet spot, you can be made to look like an idiot.

“And we need to get him back onto track. We can do that. We've got the tools, we've got the people.

“I think half of it probably just needs a bit of an arm around him and a bit of a hug and saying, ‘Come on, let's pull yourself together now and let's get on with it, do the last few races and let’s try and get back to third in the championship.’

“I think he's more than capable of doing it. It's a bit tough on him at the moment.”

Green admitted that Stroll wasn’t helped at Imola by a set-up choice that the driver requested, which led to the team replacing part of the recent suspension update package with the earlier version.

“He actually went back on a portion of that suspension for this race. And I think in hindsight, he now realises that was probably a bad move.

“I think that's all part of a bit of a lack of confidence at the moment, and questioning now where the car is and what's changed,  and making sure that it's not something we've changed.

“I think that is part of that entry sharpness that you can see, that nervousness of turning in. I think that's something that was present this weekend, and something that we'll dial out.

“The previous version was a bit too slow, basically, he thought it wasn't fast enough. So he wanted it more reactive, and we made it more reactive. But now it's too reactive. So we'll have to go back. Now he's learned the lesson.”

The late stop cost Perez a potential third place and left him rueing a “painful” outcome that saw him eventually cross the line in sixth.

From 11th on the grid Perez had used good tyre management and a long opening stint on mediums to get up to fourth, before switching to the hard tyres for the run to the flag.

When Max Verstappen’s retirement triggered a late safety car, the team was concerned that Perez would have trouble getting heat onto his hards at the restart – due to the very characteristics that had served him so well in the first part of the race. He was thus called in for a set of new softs.

However the three drivers immediately behind him, Daniel Ricciardo, Charles Leclerc and Alex Albon, all jumped him in the queue by staying out, leaving him in sixth for the resumption.

When the green flag flew, Perez lost a further place to Daniil Kvyat, who was also on fresh tyres. He then managed to pass Albon, but in the remaining laps he was not able to do anything about Leclerc up ahead, and thus had to settle for sixth.

Green said the way the car protected its tyres triggered the concerns about the restart.

“The race was going our way completely,” said Green. “Up until the safety car Checo manoeuvred himself, with great pace, up to fourth.

“He overtook the pack by going longer on the medium tyres, he drove really well, the car was really strong, we were very happy with where it was going.

“And the worst possible scenario was a safety car. And that was not really how we were geared up, unfortunately. It was always going to be a difficult decision, that one.

“We were on the hard tyres, the car had been set up, quite specifically, for the long runs, and for the race we were incredibly nervous about having to restart the hard tyres behind the safety car. And I think we would have struggled.

“So the safest thing to do and we thought that the most logical thing to do was to swap him for a set of the new softer tyres, so that we didn't have to worry about that. We thought other people might do the same, but a lot depends on how they were set up for the race.

“And I think it probably just showed where our race pace was, because we'd set the car up to look after the tyres and be kind and not overheat them. So we were always going to struggle behind the safety car in that situation.”

Green said the situation was made worse for Perez when George Russell crashed behind the safety car, extending the yellow period for a few more laps, and taking the edge off his new tyres.

“And then we've got the other thing with a second incident behind the safety car, we couldn't have predicted that one.

“So the number of laps remaining to overtake was shortened again, by a considerable margin. So I think that worked against us.

“Hindsight, we would have made a different decision. But I think at the time with the information we had that's the decision we came to.”

if he gets a third in the course of this season, and Szafnauer says that the Mexican will now have to "drive like a saint" in the remaining five races.

Perez received the first for impeding Pierre Gasly in Q2 at Portimao, and was then given a second for a blocking incident with the same driver in the closing laps of the race.

Meanwhile, Max Verstappen escaped sanction  – after Charles Leclerc also went unpunished after a similar first lap clash with his Racing Point teammate Lance Stroll in Sochi.

"They didn't touch," said Szafnauer of the Gasly blocking incident. "Sergio moved first, before Gasly did. Sergio is allowed to make that move in defence, you can't move twice, but you're allowed to move once. Gasly got out of the throttle. And there's no contact.

"So why the reprimand? On lap one Sergio is hit by Verstappen, who comes back onto the track after being off track, comes back on acutely in order to get his car in a position so he has grip again, and runs into Sergio, and they do nothing.

"Sergio and Gasly don't touch. I mean, isn't that what the fans want? Hard defending, good racing? If we start reprimanding drivers and punishing them for racing hard, but safely, where's that going to take our sport?"

With regard to the Verstappen clash, he said: "That was a collision, right? So you've got to look at a collision. The Gasly/Sergio thing was not a collision. It was a good, hard defending, and you punish that?

"But then when somebody does collide, you don't do anything? That's two times in a row. I don't know if you saw Leclerc and Lance [in Russia], it is a very similar thing. You cause a collision and then nothing. So either we're consistent... We've just got to figure it out."

Szafnauer, who said he would bring up the subject in Monday's F1 Commission meeting, stressed that a reprimand was harsher than it might appear.

"So Sergio, in his whole career, has never been reprimanded ever. He's got two this weekend. One of one of which was in qualifying, where he made a mistake in one of the sectors, didn't realise Gasly was on a fast lap behind him, and got out of the way but not quickly enough.

"Well, Gasly got through Q2 into Q3, it didn't cause him any harm. Reprimand.

"You saw the other incident, reprimand. Now for the rest of the season, he's got to drive like a saint. He's not gonna be able to fight hard, because there is a risk of a reprimand, and then you get a 10-place grid penalty. So I think that's quite harsh. You may not think that reprimand was harsh, but it is."

Szafnauer was also frustrated that Stroll was given a five-second time penalty in Portugal for

"Lance tried a couple times to overtake him as he was quicker than Lando," he said.

"And Lando decided to stay in the middle of the track, put himself in the middle, probably to defend. And Lance had a choice of going on the inside or the outside, and he chose the outside and when he turned in, they came together.

"I think the decision was a bit harsh, to give him a penalty. Is that a racing incident? Lance was a bit ahead of Lando when he turned in, Lando put himself in the middle of the track, Lance was a bit quicker.

"I don't know if Lance could have without turning in, made the corner or got around there. To me a bit of a racing incident."

Perez has been looking for a seat since Racing Point opted last month to activate a release clause in his contract for 2021, making room for Sebastian Vettel to join the team.

Perez was linked heavily with a move to either Haas or Alfa Romeo, two of the few teams to hold a vacant seat for next year.

But with Haas seemingly set to bring in F2 driver Nikita Mazepin and one of Ferrari’s juniors, and Alfa Romeo closing in on retaining its existing line-up, an option for Perez has emerged at Williams.

Although Williams announced its line-up of George Russell and Nicholas Latifi for 2021 back in July, the team has since come under new ownership, with Dorilton Capital exploring options to bring in more backing.

When asked by Motorsport.com about the possibility of a switch to Williams for next year, Perez remained coy, but said he hoped to have news on his plans in the near future.

“As I’ve said before, I haven’t signed anything,” Perez said. "So I think at the moment, there’s not a lot that I have to report or say.

“I think the season is coming to an end, so it’s getting close, and I should be in a position to say something pretty soon I think.

“Up to now, I don’t think there’s a lot of point in giving away anything, because I want to keep my negotiations private.

“I think we’ve got to be respectful of all the teams that we’re talking to. So there is no point to discuss anything at the moment.”

Should Perez land a seat at Williams, it is likely that Mercedes junior Russell would be the driver to give up his seat, with teammate Latifi already bringing sizeable financial backing to the team.

as he had a firm contract in place for next year.

Perez acknowledged that there were not many teams he could speak to about an F1 drive for next year given that most have already finalised their line-ups.

“There are not many teams out there - actually very, very few teams,” Perez said. “It’s not like a number, but there are very few teams out there that have a good project.”

DATE: 2021

Four-time F1 world champion Vettel joined the rebranded Aston Martin team for this season following his exit from , linking up with .

While Aston Martin slipped back to seventh in the constructors’ championship after being hurt by the downforce cuts under the tweaked regulations for 2021, Vettel was able to score the team’s best result of the season, finishing second in Azerbaijan.

Vettel came close to victory in Hungary, where he finished second before later being disqualified due to a technical infringement. The team announced in September that Vettel would be staying on for 2022 alongside Stroll.

Asked about Vettel’s integration at the team this year, Aston Martin boss Szafnauer said: “He’s been brilliant.

“He’s such a man of integrity, he works hard, great work ethic, leaves no stone unturned.

“The engineers like working with him, the mechanics love him as a person. He’s just a genuine guy. And that goes a long way in life.”

Vettel has gained widespread praise for his off-track efforts throughout this year, raising awareness for important environmental issues, as well as highlighting social matters such as speaking up for LGBT+ rights in Hungary.

Despite having known Vettel for over a decade, Szafnauer found it interesting to see so many of the traits he had heard about through a professional relationship, and was not surprised by his work ethic through the year.

“Everyone else that has worked closely with him talked about him in the same way that I’m talking about him now,” Szafnauer said.

“And socially, I could see those traits as well. So was I surprised, no, but I was delighted to have what I thought he was confirmed by his actions.”

Szafnauer acknowledged that it took Vettel a few races to get to know the team and get up to speed, but felt he had “done a good job”.

“His greatest quality as a racing driver is just relentlessly working at getting quicker and quicker and quicker,” Szafnauer said.

“He even does that in the race. So when he starts a race, he will look at other drivers and lines they’ve taken in the race, to see if he can learn even within a race to be able to go quicker or save the tyres more, or whatever you have to do. That to me is his biggest asset.”

Szafnauer picked out Hungary as being Vettel’s strongest race of the season, where he put  under race-long pressure in the fight for the win before finishing second and later being disqualified.

“Although the result didn’t count, through no fault of his own, I thought he drove a brilliant race in Budapest, and tried and tired and tried to overtake Ocon,” Szafnauer said.

“He wanted the win badly. It’s just so difficult to overtake in Budapest, unless you have a massive, massive car pace advantage, which we didn’t have.

“Had it been a little bit different, a bit quicker pit stop, had we just gotten out of the pits ahead of Ocon, I think he would have left him [behind].”

DATE: 2021

Vettel finished a lowly 17th in qualifying for the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, only beating teammate  and the Haas cars to leave Aston Martin as the second-slowest team.

Vettel sounded disappointed over team radio when his engineer confirmed he had only finished 17th, lapping over two-tenths of a second shy of a Q2 berth.

Aston Martin had also featured towards the lower end of the practice session results, but Vettel was surprised by its struggles as nothing had changed on the AMR21 car since Qatar.

He put Aston Martin’s weaknesses down to tyre prep, a challenge several teams have struggled with this weekend, and the Jeddah street track not suiting his car.

“It’s the same car, so I think we are just not a good match to this track,” Vettel said.

“I struggled a bit to get the tyres to work, but I think so did everybody. So it's not efficient, I guess, around here, and doesn't play to our strengths.

“The laps feel good. The balance, once we get it, is OK, but we are miles away, and then you look at the onboard from the others.

"There’s no secrets, they are just faster.”

Vettel was caught up in a traffic jam towards the end of Q1 as a number of cars bunched towards Turn 27 ahead of their flying laps. The backing-up was sparked by , who was running slowly due to an engine misfire before he ultimately got back to the pits.

“[There were] too many cars in the same spot of the track and cars not able to queue,” Vettel said.

“Some of them [were] passing. It doesn't matter. But in the end, it was two Alpines that passed and everything started to be a mess. You run out of track and there's a car coming from behind and at that point it is carnage.

“I was happy that I got the lap. Nikita [Mazepin] behind me was side-by-side down the main straight and he aborted, so it could have been me the other way around and you don't even get the final shot."

DATE: 2021

Aston Martin was hit hard by F1's aero rule tweaks for 2021 and has generally struggled to keep up with its midfield rivals throughout the season.

The former Racing Point team scored big in Monaco and Baku, where Vettel claimed his first podium for the Silverstone outfit but has since been emphatically outscored by  and , dropping down to a distant seventh in the constructors' championship.

According to Vettel, the team has been held back by excessive drag and a lack of downforce, a dreaded combination which he acknowledged is "difficult to overcome".

"We had races where the race felt really good, we had other races where I struggled a lot," Vettel said.

"Overall, what matters is how competitive you are. In competitive terms, I think our car is a bit too draggy.

"We are not having a super-efficient car, plus we don’t have enough downforce. That I think is the main weakness. From there, it’s difficult to overcome that."

The four-time world champion says he and teammate  tried hard to overcome Aston Martin's weaknesses by being smart about tyre wear, which opens up strategic options.

Last time out in Qatar Stroll managed to bag sixth after pulling off a one-stop.

"Some tracks helped it, other tracks we overcame it by maybe finding a good set-up and working well on tyres and finding a good strategy," Vettel explained.

"I think overall, when the car is in the window, then we can do a reasonable job and get into points. It’s first not always easy to get it into that window, and second, it’s extremely competitive in the area where we race.

"It seems like halfway through the season maybe other teams made a bit more progress than us now."

The 2022 season can't come soon enough for Aston Martin as it hopes to capitalise on a clean slate offered by the rules overhaul to make a fresh start.

In the meantime, it has headhunted rival staff for several key technical positions to bolster the team on the long-term, with team owner Lawrence Stroll setting his sights on competing for world titles within five years.

Vettel says that while 2022 is still an unknown, the team's growth back in the factory is impossible to ignore.

"Obviously, the big unknown is for next year, what’s happening next year with the cars changing and so on, but we will only be able to answer that question next year," he added.

"But overall, the team I find is strong. In terms of engineering and in terms of trackside, it’s strong. I think it’s growing at pace and lots of plans and good things are coming."

DATE: 2021

Blandin is still working at Brackley and is not expected to join his new team until October next year, after he has completed his gardening leave.

His appointment comes as a surprise as he is the first key player to be headhunted from , the power unit and gearbox supplier to Aston Martin.

An Aston spokesperson told Motorsport.com: “We can confirm that Eric Blandin will begin working for Aston Martin Cognizant F1 Team next year. His exact start date is not yet confirmed. The transition from Mercedes AMG F1 Team to ourselves will be an amicable one.”

The team has not specified what his role or job title will be.

Frenchman Blandin began his career at Italian wind tunnel concern Fondmetal Technologies in 1998, before moving to Jaguar Racing as an aerodynamicist in 2002.

He stayed with the Milton Keynes team through its transition to , becoming aero team leader before leaving at the end of 2009.

During that period he worked with Dan Fallows, who is leaving Red Bull to become Aston’s technical director by the start of next season.

From January 2010 Blandin spent 14 months as aero team leader at  before joining Mercedes in May 2011 as principal aerodynamicist. He was promoted to the role of chief aerodynamicist in September 2017.

Blandin joins a long list of high profile Aston Martin recruits as Stroll continues to build up his team and make it a genuine title contender.

In addition to future technical director Fallows other key hires include engineering director Luca Furbatto, who was previously with , and head of technical operations Andrew Alessi, who comes from Red Bull.

Team principal Otmar Szafnauer recently made it clear that Aston Martin was still hiring as it prepared to challenge for the World Championship.

"Things haven't slowed down in the recruitment,” he said. “But unless they're very senior, we don't we don't announce everybody. We've hired over 150 people this year, and we will continue to hire.

“If we want to win a world championship in four years’ time it does take human resource, infrastructure, factory, wind tunnel, just like the top teams, and we're on that trajectory to do that.”

Szafnauer indicated that Furbatto will start soon: “Luca will be with us within weeks. Yes, he was announced. But you know, just like everybody they've got their notice periods. So within weeks, Luca will be free to start with us.”

DATE: 2021

The single day for rookies in standard 2021 cars will be run in parallel with a two-day 18-inch tyre test for race drivers.

Aston Martin doesn't have a young driver programme and, while it potentially has access to  protege Nyck de Vries, the Formula E champion is likely to be used by the works team for the rookie test.

The Silverstone outfit looked at other options but ultimately decided that giving Yelloly a chance to correlate the sim with the real current car was the most valuable way to use the test.

The 30-year-old BMW GT racer has undertaken two tests for the team in its previous guises. He did a day with Force India in Barcelona in 2015, and followed by two days at the same venue with Racing Point in 2019.

The former GP3 and GP2 racer won the Nurburgring 24 Hours in 2020, and has been heavily involved in the development of the marque's new-for-2022 M4 GT3 racer which replaces the outgoing M6.

"Nick is a really good guy and he's been with us quite some time," Aston team principal Otmar Szafnauer told Motorsport.com

"There were other opportunities, but we had to weigh up those other opportunities with doing this.

"You're not going to use your normal racing drivers anyway. So this is a perfect trade-off."

Szafnauer stressed that the team has much to gain by improving its sim correlation.

"[Yelloly] helps to develop the simulator itself, more so than the car," he explained.

"We always to try to get the software and the hardware of the simulator working a bit better.

"And to be able to do a really good job you need to in your mind be able to correlate what you're feeling in a simulation to a real car.

"And every once in a while you have to drive a real car. So this is one opportunity we have to put him in it to help with our development, and that's what we decided to do.

"It's a good use of our test day, and simulator development ultimately helps car development."

with a possible switch to  as part of the French team's management restructuring in the near future.

Szafnauer, who has long served as the boss of the Silverstone-based F1 squad from its Force India and Racing Point days, was recently joined at Aston Martin by former  F1 chief Martin Whitmarsh as Group CEO.

Szafnauer took to Instagram to call the reports "pure media speculation and not based on fact" on Thursday evening. Aston Martin had also responded to a request for comment by calling it "speculative conjecture".

It led to a grilling for Szafnauer about his future during Friday's FIA press conference at Interlagos, during which he said he was "as surprised as anybody else" to read the reports.

"It's always humbling and flattering to say if Alpine are reorganising, I think [Alpine CEO] Laurent Rossi said that in Mexico, for the media to speculate that I could be wanted there," Szafnauer said. "It's always nice to be wanted."

Asked by Motorsport.com if he could categorically say he would be with Aston Martin next year, Szafnauer said: "I've been at the team for 12 years, I have no intention of leaving.

"I love this team. Most of the senior managers, especially through Racing Point, the senior leadership team was recruited and put there by myself, and I have no intentions of leaving them.

"I've been loyal to this team. I've had many, many offers in the 12 years that I've been working for this team, especially in the days of the bankruptcy and insolvency.

"I could have left many times, but I'm loyal to the employees there."

Throughout the remainder of the press conference, Szafnauer was given a number of opportunities to directly deny he had been in contact with Alpine or could join them in the future, but fell short of doing so.

Szafnauer was asked if he was absolutely not joining Alpine at any stage in the future, to which he replied: "I learned a long, long time ago that predicting the future is an impossibility. And if I could do that, I would be in Vegas now."

Szafnauer said he had not spoken about the reports with Aston Martin team owner Lawrence Stroll, but felt sure they would catch up at some point soon.

"We haven't talked about rumours," Szafnauer said. "There's lots of stuff that goes on in the media that we don't talk about."

Despite being "reticent to disclose contractual details", Szafnauer did confirm that he had "a long-term contract in place with Aston" when asked by Motorsport.com if he had a deal for next year.

Szafnauer noted that "many, many teams" had contacted him about a possible job this year when asked if he'd had contact with Alpine, and then referred to a press conference which occurred seven months ago that he thought may have sparked the reports.

"I think it was, I was sitting next to Laurent Rossi when [Jonathan] McEvoy asked if Aston Martin were recruiting a CEO to take my job, and I knew nothing of that," Szafnauer said.

"Jokingly, Rossi said, 'ah, if you're leaving, come talk to us', and that was about it. I don't know if that's what sparked the Auto Hebdo article."

Szafnauer added: "Like I said, I'm fully committed to the team I'm in. I've been there forever. I have no intentions of leaving.

"I've got to focus on the rest of the season. The season hasn't gone quite to what we thought it was going to, how it was going to go."

DATE: 2021

Just a week after  F1 CEO Laurent Rossi hinted at a  in a bid to move the French car manufacturer up the grid, there are mounting suggestions that Szafnauer has been poached from Aston Martin as part of this plan.

According to sources with good knowledge of the situation, Szafnauer has agreed to the move in principle but there is no formal confirmation yet.

It is unclear when any official announcement will be made. It could potentially come as early as this weekend's Brazilian Grand Prix, or it may wait for the winter to fall in line with a timeline laid out by Rossi.

Both Aston Martin and Alpine have declined to comment on the matter.

An Aston Martin spokesman said: "It's speculative conjecture. We couldn't comment on it therefore."

An Alpine spokesman added: "These are rumours that we are not going to comment on."

Szfanauer said on Thursday evening that the reports were just "media speculation".

"My Aston Martin team communications staff have correctly issued a spokesperson's statement to the effect that rumours linking me to Alpine F1 team are merely 'speculative conjecture' and that they would not therefore comment further," he wrote on Instagram.

"However, since the rumours have now been sensationalised on certain websites, creating a spiral of misinformation, l have taken the decision proactively to confirm hereby that the rumours are pure media speculation and not based on fact."

While there is no news yet about the position that Szafnauer could take, it is possible that his arrival will prompt a wider change of structure at Alpine.

There have been indications for some time that Alpine's racing director Davide Brivio will return to MotoGP for 2022 after deciding that he would prefer a return to two-wheeled racing.

If Brivio does depart, it means that Szafnauer could fulfil more of a team principal role, with Alpine's executive director Marcin Budkowski taking more responsibility on the racing and technical side.

Rossi suggested recently that Alpine needed to shake things up for 2022 after feeling that its progress towards the front of the grid had stalled.

"I think the team has moved from P9 to P5, before the plateau we've reached, pretty well in the past years," Rossi told Motorsport.com.

"But now, to move to the next stage and become the best of the top teams rather than just the best of the rest, it's another evolution that is needed.

"So what I want to do is to keep the momentum of the prior season, that's why I want to keep that fifth position. I don't want us to regress.

"We learned a lot operationally this year, so that's always a plus. We're going to apply that next year, but then we're going to need to build muscles to grow and move from P5 to P1, race after race, season after season in the next few years."

If Szafnauer's departure is confirmed, then it is unclear at this stage who will replace him as team principal at Aston Martin.

The Silverstone squad recently hired former  team boss Martin Whitmarsh to a senior role with Aston Martin Performance Technologies, but he has been present at grands prix and would be an obvious candidate.

Speaking recently, Szafnauer said he did not expect Whitmarsh to be involved much in the F1 team – but a final call had not been made.

"I would imagine at the beginning, most of his time will be spent growing the Aston Martin Performance Technologies area, which is where his most recent expertise lies, and not focus so much on F1," he said.

"But the bit that hasn't been planned is how much of his time will be spent where."

SOURCE: https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/weight-a-key-factor-in-aston-martins-tweaked-green-f1-livery-choice/6692174/
DATE: 2021

The Silverstone-based team has begun looking into a potential tweak of its green livery for 2022, with the dark pantone having not been as good as it originally hoped.

While the team was happy with how the green looked in real life, the colours have not come across as well on television images.

And, in particular with the way that cameras pick up the light, the dark Aston Martin has often been hard to distinguish from the black  in certain angles.

Speaking earlier this year, team principal Otmar Szafnauer said that the type of green used on its car would be reconsidered.

"I think it's a stunning colour in the sun and when you're looking at it in person," he said.

"But I believe we should be looking at making it pop a little bit more on television, without losing the green when you're looking at it outside.

"I don't know if we can do that, but that's one thing that we're looking to do, just to make sure that it differentiates itself on TV from some of the other darker cars."

Talks at Aston Martin about its 2022 livery, and the choice of green, began this week at its Silverstone factory, with senior chiefs now working out what would be best.

But Szafnauer is clear that the team needs to carefully consider any change of green, and especially cannot choose one based on optics if it ends up adding too much weight to the car.

Asked by Motorsport.com about the latest situation on the paint scheme, Szafnauer explained that one of the key issues the team faced for 2022 was getting close to the minimum weight limit.

"We just started looking at that," explained Szafnauer in a media call ahead of the United States Grand Prix.

"We've had a senior team management meeting and we started talking about next year's paint, and how much of the car we will be painting next year, with what colour.

"But weight is also a big factor. We've got to take as much weight out as we can. So we're just in the process of that now."

Aston Martin is not alone in facing a battle to get its car close to the minimum weight limit for 2022.

New regulations, increased crash test demands, plus larger wheels and brakes, has led to an increase in the mass of cars – and teams are reluctant in the cost cap era about being forced to use expensive weight-saving materials.

The latest update of F1's 2022 regulations published this week lifted the minimum weight to 792kg for next year, but teams still think it will be tough to hit that.

has prompted renewed concerns about regimes with poor human rights records using grand prix racing as a sportswashing exercise.

However, F1 chiefs and the FIA have long argued that sports should remain neutral, and that racing in places like that can have a positive by highlighting potential issues.

But Vettel thinks there comes a point where the sport has to make a decision on morality grounds, and not just because it wants to try to increase profits.

Speaking to selected media, including Motorsport.com, in a wide-racing interview on human rights, sustainability and tolerance, Vettel said that profits should not be the sole factor in deciding where sports events are hosted.

"I think the trouble is that ultimately a sport, and it's the same as a country, is governed by individual people," he said.

"Individual people have individual opinions, and backgrounds, whatever, so it is of course difficult.

"But we have to find the perfect people to sort of govern our sport, and then apply the right path going forward.

"There's more than just that interest, there's obviously huge financial interest, in going forward. But I think at some point you need to ask your question, and people in charge need to ask themselves the question: do you have a moral?

"Do you therefore say no to certain things? Or do you just say 'yes' to any big deal that's around the corner, but for the wrong reasons?

"I think that's the bigger picture stuff that people in charge ultimately need to ask themselves."

Vettel has been a strong campaigner this year on a number of issues, including the environment and highlighting LGBT rights.

And while F1 has made a lot of its #weraceasone campaign, Vettel believes that the sport needs to put actions behind its words, and do more than a simple ceremony before every race.

"I think there are certain topics that are too big to neglect," he said. "I think we all agree that – and this doesn't matter where you come from – it's only fair to treat people equally.

"I think there are obviously countries that have different rules in place, different governments, different backgrounds.

"Now, I can't speak for all the countries and be an expert, because I don't know. But obviously there's certain aspects in certain countries that I think I know about.

"We go to some of those places, and we roll out a huge carpet with nice messages on it. But I think it takes more than just words, I think it takes actions."

Asked if F1 should be more militant, Vettel said: "I don't know what exactly is the best way to not just communicate on a flag that lies on the track for a couple of minutes.

"But certainly I feel that our sport could apply a lot of pressure and could be of immense help to spread that fairness around the globe even more.

"Because in the end, I think it's not right to judge people or to apply certain laws and to differentiate people just because they happen to love a man instead of a woman or a woman instead of a man.

"I think any form of separation is wrong. Imagine we would all be the same, I think we wouldn't progress.

"I mean, imagine all the cars would look the same in Formula 1. It would be boring: not just the same colour, but also the same aero bits. Now going more into our language, it would be absolutely boring, we would never make progress.

"And the same goes for us. I think we have evolved so much as human species, because we are all different in a way, and I think we should celebrate the difference, rather than be afraid of it."

The German was running in 10th place when he was told there was a pitstop window as other drivers were stopping for a second set of intermediates.

Asked on lap 36 if he might want to try soft tyres should slicks become an option Vettel responded, “Medium, medium, let’s go for it. These inters can’t be any worse.”

The team confirmed that he should box and he came straight in. However, he almost lost the car as he accelerated out of the pit exit, and immediately realised his mistake.

Having twice gone off the road on his out lap and lost a lot of time he was called back in for fresh intermediates, losing more ground with a half-spin in the pit entry.

He tumbled down the order and was eventually classified 18th, ahead only of Haas drivers  and .

“He wanted to gamble himself, we didn't tell him no,” Szafnauer told Motorsport.com. “Seb came on the radio and he said, ‘I want dry tyres, put mediums on,’ and we didn't challenge him, we did what he said. It happened pretty quickly, so we didn't debate that long with him.

“Oftentimes we say that in drying conditions like that, it's a driver's choice. And we went with that. The other way round it's more of a team thing, but on a drying track the driver's out there feeling it.

“It's just I think this track here is a normal drying track, it doesn't dry normally so it's hard to predict. He knew right away the grip wasn't there, so he came in the next lap, but he lost a lot of time."

Asked if the team had any regrets given that a top 10 finish was potentially lost, Szafnauer said: "You have to trust him, and the other thing you got to trust is he is good in the wet and tricky conditions, and that's exactly what was out there.

“So if he says I can do it then who are we to argue? But I think this wasn't the norm, it's a different track in the wet. Should have, could have, would have, had it worked and he finished fourth or on the podium we would have been happy. So no risk, no reward.

“It wasn't just the one extra pitstop, because the pit loss is around 20 seconds around here, but it was the extra 30 seconds he lost on that lap and that's what killed him.

"On the intermediate he did really good lap times once he got through the graining phase."

Meanwhile Vettel’s teammate  earned two points with ninth place, having passed non-stopper  in the closing laps.

Szafnauer said of that drive: "A good solid performance, he had good lap times all race. I think we pitted him at the right time. We had a bit of a slow stop unfortunately, and it’s hard to tell where he would ended up. [Carlos] Sainz was pretty quick once he got through the graining phase. But so was Lance, so good performance."

of the newly-created Aston Martin Performance Technologies entity.

Since leaving McLaren in 2014, the 63-year-old has mainly been involved in the America's Cup with Ben Ainslie Racing, latterly as chairman of BAR Technologies.

He also briefly had a consultancy role with the FIA when the new financial regulations were being put together.

Szafnauer says that in his new job, Whitmarsh has a wider brief than just the racing team, encompassing Aston Martin's efforts to exploit F1 technology outside the sport, and thus his own responsibilities remain unchanged.

"The F1 side will remain under my leadership and remit," he said. "So I'll still be team principal and CEO. Martin will be group CEO, with the F1 side reporting through him.

"So I guess the only thing that hasn't been planned is how much of his time, because he's got the entire group, does he spend on each one of those entities?

"I would imagine at the beginning most of his time will be spent growing the Aston Martin Performance Technologies area, which is where his most recent expertise lies, and not focus so much on F1. But the bit that hasn't been planned is how much of his time will be spent where."

Szafnauer says that Whitmarsh brings valuable knowledge of using technology outside sport gained while working at both McLaren and with BAR. The team's new Silverstone base has been designed to encompass non-racing projects.

"He was there at McLaren when they started doing that, so he's got that experience, and he can lead us to shortcuts in doing that.

"He's also had seven years now of boat racing experience, including starting a new company that is taking technologies from boat racing and moving that technology into I think cargo ships.

"And it's an applied technology type business, technology transfer. He's got good experience in that, and he'll help us shortcut the development of our performance technology business."

Four-time world champion  over joining the team for next season after Ferrari opted against renewing his contract beyond this year. , but said he has not signed any agreement with the team.

Racing Point currently has Perez and teammate Lance Stroll under long-term contracts. Perez is in the first year of a three-year deal, but the team has refused to rule out both drivers staying on for 2021. Stroll is the son of Racing Point owner Lawrence Stroll, making it likely that he would remain with the team for 2021 when it will be rebranded as Aston Martin.

Perez stressed last week that he had a valid contract for next season but has conceded he would be likely to leave should Stroll Sr. opt to sign Vettel to partner his son.

“I think [the choice] is obvious if someone has to go,” Perez said in an interview on Movistar+ F1. “I'm a dad, I wouldn't kick my son out, but there's not much I can say. There are many [rumours] around. From me, nothing – everything remains the same. I have a contract with the team.”

Perez revealed last week that he has  and teams in other championships about a drive for 2021 in light of the rumours. It has been reported that there is an exit clause in Perez’s contract that needs to be triggered by the team for him to leave for 2021 and make room for Vettel.

Perez said in the interview that his contract does have a break clause, relating to his sponsorship agreements. He has enjoyed significant backing from Mexican telecommunications giant Telmex.

“In all contracts, there are always clauses,” Perez said. “It is a bit related to sponsorship. That can open that clause. But we're working hard with all our sponsors so that this does not happen.

“I would not say that it depends on a single sponsor, it is more of an overall issue.”
